# cd

切换当前工作目录。

```bash
..
-
~
```

The `cd` (Change Directory) command allows you to change the current directory, in other words, to move through the tree.

```
$ cd /tmp
$ pwd
/tmp
$ cd ../
$ pwd
/
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/rockstar
```

As you can see in the last example above, the command `cd` with no arguments moves the current directory to the `home directory`.
