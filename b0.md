For customers who use the default schedules, the software is automatically downloaded on or after October 15th, 2017.

## Upgrades

Upgrades from previous versions are supported. When your CommServe is eligible for upgrade, you will see the ** Request Upgrade to V11** option in your [ dashboard](https://cloud.commvault.com/webconsole/survey/reports/dashboard.jsp). If you do not see the option, see [Upgrades - FAQ](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=deployment/upgrade/r_upgrade_faq.htm).

For general information about upgrades, see [Upgrades](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=deployment/common_upgrade/c_upgrade_overview.htm).

## [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]()

Oracle has discovered an issue with some versions of their Java software. This issue prevents the CommCell Console from starting when it is accessed as a web-based application. To avoid this issue, you can install Java version 1.8.0_101 and all subsequent CPU (Critical Patch Update) versions. Do not install Java 8 Update 72, 74, 77, 91, 92, or 102 (versions 1.8.0_72, 1.8.0_74, 1.8.0_77, 1.8.0_91, 1.8.0_92, and 1.8.0_102).

## CommServe Server and MediaAgents Can Be a Virtual Machine

You can use virtual machines instead of physical clients for the CommServe server and MediaAgents. Virtual machines must meet the same hardware specifications as physical clients, such as CPU, RAM, IOPs, and network requirements.

We recommend that you manage extra-large backend data (up to 400 TB) with a single extra-large MediaAgent using two DDB (deduplication database) partitions. For more information, see [Hardware Specifications for Deduplication Extended Mode](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=system_requirements/commcell_sizing/ma_dedup_ext_mode.htm).

## For VMware using ESXi 6.0 EP6 (build 3825889), incremental backups that use application quiescing are equivalent to Full Backups

A known issue with VMware ESXi 6.0 EP6 (build 3825889) caused Changed Block Tracking (CBT) to return all blocks for a virtual disk, resulting in backups that were the total size of the virtual disk. This affected backup applications, including Commvault, when incremental backups were run using application consistent quiescing with CBT, for guest virtual machines running Windows 2008 or later.

**Note:** This issue did not result in data loss, but did increase the size and running time of incremental backups.

You can resolve this issue by applying the patch that was provided by VMware in [VMware ESXi 6.0, Patch ESXi-6.0.0-20160804001-standard (2145667)](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2145667).

For more information, see the VMware KB article [ After upgrading to ESXi 6.0 Build 3825889, incremental virtual machine backups effectively run as full backups when application consistent quiescing is enabled (2145895)](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2145895).

## [Security]()

### Installing Windows Updates on All Clients in a Client Computer Group

To keep your CommCell environment secure, you must stay up-to-date with all Windows operating system updates. You can use the **Install Windows Updates** workflow to download and install Microsoft updates on all client computers in a client computer group. Download the **Install Windows Updates** workflow from Commvault Store. For instructions, see [Download Workflows from Commvault Store](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=features/workflow/download_workflow.htm). For details about the **Install Windows Updates** workflow, see [Install Windows Updates Workflow](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=features/workflow/templates/install_win_updates.htm).

### Apache Tomcat Vulnerability Posted by NVD

Our engineering team has reviewed the [ NVD posting](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12617) regarding the CVE-2017-12617 vulnerability in Apache Tomcat software, as well as the [ response by Apache](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3fd341a604c4e9eab39e7eaabbbac39c30101a022acc11dd09d7ebcb@%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%253E). Based on our review, we can report that the configuration used by Commvault Tomcat installations does not include the WebDav servlet and does not alter the default value of "true" for default servlet init-param "readonly". All versions of V10 and V11 Commvault software are unaffected by this potential vulnerability.

### MongoDB Security Implementation

Commvault software uses the MongoDB Enterprise 3.0.2 database program to store and to retrieve comments and replies associated with Edge Drive objects. During the installation of MongoDB, Commvault enables authentication mode and updates the default user credentials with a random password. For more information about Commvault and MongoDB, see [MongoDB Security, Usage, Installation, and De-installation](http://kb.commvault.com/#!/SEC0012) on the Commvault knowledge base website.

### Cross-protocol attack on TLS on OpenSSL using SSLv2 (DROWN)

We have reviewed the [OpenSSL Security Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160301.txt) posted on March 1, 2016, and can report that our firewall code uses TLS 1.2 and therefore is unaffected by this potential vulnerability.

For Commvault Web Console or Web Server, ensure that you are using the latest version of Microsoft IIS and that SSLv2 is disabled. Refer to the following articles for more information:

- [How to Disable SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 in IIS 7](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-disable-ssl-2.0-in-iis-7.html)
- [How to Disable Weak Ciphers and SSL 2.0 in Tomcat](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-disable-weak-ciphers-and-ssl-2-in-tomcat.html)

### Linux Kernel Vulnerability Posted by NVD

Our engineering team has reviewed the [NVD posting](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0728) regarding a potential vulnerability in the Linux kernel before 4.4.1, as well as the [response by RedHat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2016-0728). Based on our review, we can report that Commvault does not use this API in our backup and recovery code, and our File Recovery Enabler for Linux uses Centos 6.x kernels, and thus our software is not vulnerable to this potential threat.

### Vulnerability Posted by Software Engineering Institute â€“ CERT Division

Commvault acts swiftly on all security risks to verify the authenticity of the risk and any required resolution of that risk for all supported versions of our software. Our engineering team has reviewed the [CERT](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/866432) posting and we have identified a potential security vulnerability in the Web Console through our own testing. At this time, there have been no customer reports of this issue.

This vulnerability is addressed in Version 11 SP1. It is not necessary to download or install any separate Hotfix to address it.

### OpenSSL Security Advisory dated 3 Dec 2015 - Update 4 Dec 2015 

OpenSSL vulnerabilities CVE-2015-1794, CVE-2015-3193, CVE-2015-3194, and CVE-2015-3195 as described in OpenSSL.org's Security Advisory do not affect Commvault software.

### Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Our engineering team has reviewed the [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/214283) posting on the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability for Commvault Edge and have addressed this issue in Version 11 Service Pack 7. 

 For more information, see KB article [SEC0013: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability](http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/relatedLinks?action=knowledgebase&key=SEC0013).
