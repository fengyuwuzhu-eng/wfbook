# Troubleshooting[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting)



## Debug Messages[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#debug-messages)

The Bareos programs contain a lot of debug messages. Normally, these are not printed. See the [setdebug](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/BareosConsole.html#bcommandsetdebug) chapter about how to enable them.



## Client Access Problems[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#client-access-problems)

There are several reasons why a Bareos Director could not contact a client on a different machine. They are:

- Check if the client file daemon is really running.
- The Client address or port is incorrect or not resolved by DNS.  See if you can ping the client machine using the same address as in the  Client record.
- You have a firewall, and it is blocking traffic on port 9102  between the Director’s machine and the Client’s machine (or on port 9103 between the Client and the Storage daemon machines).
- Your password or names are not correct in both the Director and  the Client machine. Try configuring everything identical to how you run  the client on the same machine as the Director, but just change the  address. If that works, make the other changes one step at a time until  it works.

Some of the DNS and Firewall problems can be circumvented by configuring clients as  [Passive Clients](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/NetworkSetup.html#section-passiveclient) or using [Client Initiated Connection](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/NetworkSetup.html#section-clientinitiatedconnection) .

### Difficulties Connecting from the FD to the SD[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#difficulties-connecting-from-the-fd-to-the-sd)

If you are having difficulties getting one or more of  your File daemons to connect to the Storage daemon, it is most likely  because you have not used a fully qualified domain name on the [`Address (Dir->Storage)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Storage_Address) directive. That is the resolver on the File daemon’s machine (not on  the Director’s) must be able to resolve the name you supply into an IP  address. An example of an address that is guaranteed not to work: **localhost**. An example that may work: **bareos-sd1**. An example that is more likely to work: **bareos-sd1.example.com**.

You can verify how a Bareos File Daemon resolves a DNS name by the following command:

Test DNS resolution on the Bareos File Daemon name{bareos-fd}[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#id1)

```
*resolve client=bareos-fd NONEXISTINGHOSTNAME
Connecting to Client bareos-fd at bareos:9102
bareos-fd: Failed to resolve NONEXISTINGHOSTNAME
*resolve client=bareos-fd bareos-sd1.example.com
Connecting to Client bareos-fd at bareos:9102
bareos-fd resolves bareos-sd1.example.com to host[ipv4;192.168.0.1]
```

If your address is correct, then make sure that no other program is using  the port 9103 on the Storage daemon’s machine. The Bacula project has  reserved these port numbers by IANA, therefore they should only be used  by Bacula and its replacements like Bareos. However, apparently some HP  printers do use these port numbers. A **netstat -lntp** on the Bareos Storage Daemon’s machine can determine who is listening  on the 9103 port (used for FD to SD communications in Bareos).

### Authorization Errors[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#authorization-errors)

For security  reasons, Bareos requires that both the Bareos File Daemon and the Bareos Storage Daemon know the name of the Bareos Director as well as its  password. As a consequence, if you change the Bareos Director’s name or  password, you must make the corresponding change in the Bareos File  Daemon’s and in the Bareos Storage Daemon’s configuration files.

During the authorization process, the Bareos File Daemon and Bareos  Storage Daemon also require that the Bareos Director authenticates  itself, so both ends require the other to have the correct name and  password.

If you have edited the configuration files and modified any name or  any password, and you are getting authentication errors, then your best  bet is to go back to the original configuration files generated by the  Bareos installation process. Make only the absolutely necessary  modifications to these files – e.g. add the correct email address. Then  follow the instructions in the [Running Bareos](https://docs.bareos.org/IntroductionAndTutorial/Tutorial.html#tutorialchapter) chapter of this manual. You will run a backup to disk and a restore. Only when that works, should you begin customization of the configuration files.

Some users report that authentication fails if there is not a proper  reverse DNS lookup entry for the machine. This seems to be a requirement of gethostbyname(), which is what Bareos uses to translate names into  IP addresses. If you cannot add a reverse DNS entry, or you don’t know  how to do so, you can avoid the problem by specifying an IP address  rather than a machine name in the appropriate Bareos configuration file.

Here is a picture that indicates what names/passwords in which files/Resources must match up:

[![../_images/Conf-Diagram.png](https://docs.bareos.org/_images/Conf-Diagram.png)](https://docs.bareos.org/_images/Conf-Diagram.png)

In the left column, you will find the Bareos Director, Bareos Storage Daemon, and Bareos File Daemon resources, with their names and  passwords – these are all in the Bareos Director configuration. The  right column is where the corresponding values should be found in the  Console, Bareos Storage Daemon (SD), and Bareos File Daemon (FD)  configuration files.

Another thing to check is to ensure that the Bareos component you are trying to access has **Maximum Concurrent Jobs** set large enough to handle each of the Jobs and the Console that want  to connect simultaneously. Once the maximum connections has been  reached, each Bareos component will reject all new connections.



## Concurrent Jobs[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#concurrent-jobs)

Bareos can run multiple concurrent jobs. Using the **Maximum Concurrent Jobs** directives, you can configure how many and which jobs can be run simultaneously:

Bareos Director

> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_MaximumConcurrentJobs)
> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Dir->Client)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Client_MaximumConcurrentJobs)
> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Dir->Job)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Job_MaximumConcurrentJobs)
> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Dir->Storage)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Storage_MaximumConcurrentJobs)

Bareos Storage Daemon

> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Sd->Storage)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Storage_MaximumConcurrentJobs)
> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_MaximumConcurrentJobs)

Bareos File Daemon

> - [`Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Fd->Client)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/FileDaemon.html#config-Fd_Client_MaximumConcurrentJobs)

For example, if you want two different jobs to run simultaneously  backing up the same Client to the same Storage device, they will run  concurrently only if you have set **Maximum Concurrent Jobs** greater than one in the [`Director (Dir)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_Name) resource, the [`Client (Dir)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Client_Name) resource, and the [`Storage (Dir)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Storage_Name) resource in Bareos Director configuration.

When running concurrent jobs without [Data Spooling](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/DataSpooling.html#section-dataspooling), the volume format becomes more complicated, consequently, restores may  take longer if Bareos must sort through interleaved volume blocks from  multiple simultaneous jobs. This can be avoided by having each  simultaneous job write to a different volume or by using data spooling  We recommend that you read the [Data Spooling](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/DataSpooling.html#section-dataspooling) of this manual first, then test your multiple concurrent backup including restore testing before you put it into production.

When using random access media as backup space (e.g. disk), you should also read the chapter about [Concurrent Disk Jobs](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/VolumeManagement.html#concurrentdiskjobs).

Below is a super stripped down Bareos Director configuration showing  you the four places where that must be modified to allow the same job [`NightlySave (Dir->Job)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Job_Name) to run up to four times concurrently. The change to the Job resource is not necessary if you want different Jobs to run at the same time, which is the normal case.

Concurrent Jobs Example[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#id2)

```
#
# Bareos Director Configuration /etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/*
#
Director {
  Name = bareos-dir
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
  ...
}
Job {
  Name = "NightlySave"
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
  Client = bareos-fd
  Storage = File
  ...
}
Client {
  Name = bareos-fd
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
  ...
}
Storage {
  Name = File
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
  ...
}
```



## Tape Labels: ANSI or IBM[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#tape-labels-ansi-or-ibm)

Warning

ANSI/IBM labels have been deprecated as of Bareos 23. Support will be removed in the future.

By default, Bareos uses its own tape label ([`Label Type (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_LabelType)). However, Bareos also supports reading and writing ANSI and IBM tape labels.

### Reading[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#reading)

Reading ANSI/IBM labels is important, if some of your tapes are used  by other programs that also support ANSI/IBM labels. For example, LTFS  tapes  are indicated by an ANSI label.

If your are running Bareos in such an environment, you must set [`Check Labels (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_CheckLabels) to yes, otherwise Bareos will not recognize that these tapes are already in use.

### Writing[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#writing)

To configure Bareos to also write ANSI/IBM tape labels, use [`Label Type (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_LabelType) or [`Label Type (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_LabelType). With the proper configuration, you can force Bareos to require ANSI or IBM labels.

Even though Bareos will recognize and write ANSI and IBM labels, it always writes its own tape labels as well.

If you have labeled your volumes outside of Bareos, then the ANSI/IBM label will be recognized by Bareos only if you have created the HDR1  label with BAREOS.DATA in the filename field (starting with character  5). If Bareos writes the labels, it will use this information to  recognize the tape as a Bareos tape. This allows ANSI/IBM labeled tapes  to be used at sites with multiple machines and multiple backup programs.



## Tape Drive[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#tape-drive)

This chapter is concerned with testing and configuring  your tape drive to make sure that it will work properly with Bareos  using the btape program.

### Get Your Tape Drive Working[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#get-your-tape-drive-working)

In general, you should follow the following steps to get your tape  drive to work with Bareos. Start with a tape mounted in your drive. If  you have an autochanger, load a tape into the drive. We use /dev/nst0 as the tape drive name, you will need to adapt it according to your  system.

Do not proceed to the next item until you have succeeded with the previous one.

1. Make sure that Bareos (the Storage daemon) is not running or that you have unmounted the drive you will use for testing.

2. Use tar to write to, then read from your drive:

   ```
   mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
   tar cvf /dev/nst0 .
   mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
   tar tvf /dev/nst0
   ```

Make sure you  have a valid and correct Device resource corresponding to your drive.  For Linux users, generally, the default one works. For FreeBSD users,  there are two possible Device configurations (see below). For other  drives and/or OSes, you will need to first ensure that your system tape  modes are properly setup (see below), then possibly modify you Device  resource depending on the output from the btape program (next item).  When doing this, you should consult the [Storage Daemon Configuration](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#storedconfchapter) of this manual.

If you are using a Fibre Channel to connect your tape drive to  Bareos, please be sure to disable any caching in the NSR (network  storage router, which is a Fibre Channel to SCSI converter).

Run the btape test command:

```
btape /dev/nst0
test
```

It isn’t necessary to run the autochanger  part of the test at this time, but do not go past this point until the  basic test succeeds. If you do have an autochanger, please be sure to  read the [Autochanger chapter](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/AutochangerSupport.html#autochangerschapter) of this manual.

Run the btape fill command, preferably with two volumes. This can take a long time. If you have an autochanger and it is configured,  Bareos will automatically use it. If you do not have it configured, you  can manually issue the appropriate mtx command, or press the autochanger buttons to change the tape when requested to do so.

Run Bareos, and backup a reasonably small directory, say 60 Megabytes. Do three successive backups of this directory.

Stop Bareos, then restart it. Do another full backup of the same directory. Then stop and restart Bareos.

Do a restore of the directory backed up, by entering the  following restore command, being careful to restore it to an alternate  location:

```
restore select all done
yes
```

Do a diff on the restored directory to  ensure it is identical to the original directory. If you are going to  backup multiple different systems (Linux, Windows, Mac, Solaris,  FreeBSD, …), be sure you test the restore on each system type.

If you have an autochanger, you should now go back to the btape program and run the autochanger test:

```
btape /dev/nst0
auto
```

1. Adjust your autochanger as necessary to ensure that it works correctly. See the [Autochanger chapter](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#autochangertesting) of this manual for a complete discussion of testing your autochanger.

## Autochanger[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#autochanger)



### Testing Autochanger and Adapting mtx-changer script[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#testing-autochanger-and-adapting-mtx-changer-script)



In case, Bareos does not work well with the Autochanger, it is preferable  to “hand-test” that the changer works. To do so, we suggest you do the  following commands:

Make sure Bareos is not running.

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 list 0 /dev/nst0 0**

This command should print:

```
1:
2:
3:
...
```

or one number per line for each slot that is occupied in your changer, and the number should be  terminated by a colon (:). If your changer has barcodes, the barcode  will follow the colon. If an error message is printed, you must resolve  the problem (e.g. try a different SCSI control device name if /dev/sg0  is incorrect). For example, on FreeBSD systems, the autochanger SCSI  control device is generally /dev/pass2.

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 listall 0 /dev/nst0 0**

This command should print:

```
Drive content:         D:Drive num:F:Slot loaded:Volume Name
D:0:F:2:vol2        or D:Drive num:E
D:1:F:42:vol42
D:3:E

Slot content:
S:1:F:vol1             S:Slot num:F:Volume Name
S:2:E               or S:Slot num:E
S:3:F:vol4

Import/Export tray slots:
I:10:F:vol10           I:Slot num:F:Volume Name
I:11:E              or I:Slot num:E
I:12:F:vol40
```

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 transfer 1 2**

This command should transfer a volume from source (1) to destination (2)

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 slots**

This command should return the number of slots in your autochanger.

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 unload 1 /dev/nst0 0**

If a tape is loaded from slot 1, this should cause it to be unloaded.

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 load 3 /dev/nst0 0**

Assuming you have a tape in slot 3, it will be loaded into drive (0).

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 loaded 0 /dev/nst0 0**

It should print “3” Note, we have used an “illegal”  slot number 0. In this case, it is simply ignored because the slot  number is not used. However, it must be specified because the drive  parameter at the end of the command is needed to select the correct  drive.

**/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 unload 3 /dev/nst0 0**

will unload the tape into slot 3.

Once all the above commands work correctly, assuming that you have  the right Changer Command in your configuration, Bareos should be able  to operate the changer. The only remaining area of problems will be if  your autoloader needs some time to get the tape loaded after issuing the command. After the mtx-changer script returns, Bareos will immediately  rewind and read the tape. If Bareos gets rewind I/O errors after a tape  change, you will probably need to configure the **load_sleep** paramenter in the config file `/etc/bareos/mtx-changer.conf`. You can test whether or not you need a sleep by putting the following commands into a file and running it as a script:

Testing if sleep is needed between unload and load[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#id3)

```
#!/bin/sh
/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 unload 1 /dev/nst0 0
/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 load 3 /dev/nst0 0
mt -f /dev/st0 rewind
mt -f /dev/st0 weof
```

If the above script runs, you probably have  no timing problems. If it does not run, start by putting a sleep 30 or  possibly a sleep 60 in the script just after the mtx-changer load  command. If that works, then you should configure the **load_sleep** paramenter in the config file `/etc/bareos/mtx-changer.conf` to the specified value so that it will be effective when Bareos runs.

A second problem that comes up with a small number of autochangers is that they need to have the cartridge ejected before it can be removed.  If this is the case, the load 3 will never succeed regardless of how  long you wait. If this seems to be your problem, you can insert an eject just after the unload so that the script looks like:

Testing if offline is needed[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#id4)

```
#!/bin/sh
/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 unload 1 /dev/nst0 0
mt -f /dev/st0 offline
/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer /dev/sg0 load 3 /dev/nst0 0
mt -f /dev/st0 rewind
mt -f /dev/st0 weof
```

If this solves your problems, set the parameter **offline** in the config file `/etc/bareos/mtx-changer.conf` to “1”.

## Restore[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#restore)

### Restore a pruned job using a pattern[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#restore-a-pruned-job-using-a-pattern)

It is possible to configure Bareos in a way, that job  information are still stored in the Bareos catalog, while the individual file information are already pruned.

If all File records are pruned from the catalog for a Job, normally  Bareos can restore only all files saved. That is there is no way using  the catalog to select individual files. With this new feature, Bareos  will ask if you want to specify a Regex expression for extracting only a part of the full backup.

Restoring pruned files job using regex to filter[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#id5)

```
  Building directory tree for JobId(s) 1,3 ...
  There were no files inserted into the tree, so file selection
  is not possible.Most likely your retention policy pruned the files

  Do you want to restore all the files? (yes|no): no

  Regexp matching files to restore? (empty to abort): /etc/.*
  Bootstrap records written to /tmp/regress/working/zog4-dir.restore.1.bsr
```

See also [FileRegex bsr option](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#fileregex) for more information.

### Problems Restoring Files[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#problems-restoring-files)

The most frequent problems users have restoring files are error messages such as:

```
04-Jan 00:33 z217-sd: RestoreFiles.2005-01-04_00.31.04 Error:
block.c:868 Volume data error at 20:0! Short block of 512 bytes on
device /dev/tape discarded.
```

or

```
04-Jan 00:33 z217-sd: RestoreFiles.2005-01-04_00.31.04 Error:
block.c:264 Volume data error at 20:0! Wanted ID: "BB02", got ".".
Buffer discarded.
```

Both these  kinds of messages indicate that you were probably running your tape  drive in fixed block mode rather than variable block mode. Fixed block  mode will work with any program that reads tapes sequentially such as  tar, but Bareos repositions the tape on a block basis when restoring  files because this will speed up the restore by orders of magnitude when only a few files are being restored. There are several ways that you  can attempt to recover from this unfortunate situation.

Try the following things, each separately, and reset your Device resource to what it is now after each individual test:

1. Set “Block Positioning = no” in your Device resource and try the restore. This is a new directive and untested.
2. Set “Minimum Block Size = 512” and “Maximum Block Size = 512” and try the restore. If you are able to determine the block size your drive was previously using, you should try that size if 512 does not work.  This is a really horrible solution, and it is not at all recommended to  continue backing up your data without correcting this condition. Please  see the [Tape Drive](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#tapetestingchapter) section for more on this.
3. Try editing the restore.bsr file at the Run xxx yes/mod/no prompt before starting the restore job and remove all the VolBlock statements. These are what causes Bareos to reposition the tape, and where problems occur if you have a fixed block size set for your drive. The VolFile  commands also cause repositioning, but this will work regardless of the  block size.
4. Use bextract to extract the files you want – it reads the Volume  sequentially if you use the include list feature, or if you use a .bsr  file, but remove all the VolBlock statements after the .bsr file is  created (at the Run yes/mod/no) prompt but before you start the restore.

### Restoring Files Can Be Slow[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#restoring-files-can-be-slow)

Restoring files is generally much slower than backing  them up for several reasons. The first is that during a backup the tape  is normally already positioned and Bareos only needs to write. On the  other hand, because restoring files is done so rarely, Bareos keeps only the start file and block on the tape for the whole job rather than on a file by file basis which would use quite a lot of space in the catalog.

Bareos will forward space to the correct file mark on the tape for  the Job, then forward space to the correct block, and finally  sequentially read each record until it gets to the correct one(s) for  the file or files you want to restore. Once the desired files are  restored, Bareos will stop reading the tape.

Finally, instead of just reading a file for backup, during the  restore, Bareos must create the file, and the operating system must  allocate disk space for the file as Bareos is restoring it.

For all the above reasons the restore process is generally much slower than backing up (sometimes it takes three times as long).



### Restoring When Things Go Wrong[](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/Troubleshooting.html#restoring-when-things-go-wrong)

This and the following sections will try to present a  few of the kinds of problems that can come up making restoring more  difficult. We will try to provide a few ideas how to get out of these  problem situations. In addition to what is presented here, there is more specific information on restoring a [Client](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/DisasterRecoveryUsingBareos.html#section-baremetalrestoreclient) and your [Server](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/DisasterRecoveryUsingBareos.html#section-restoreserver) in the [Disaster Recovery Using Bareos](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/DisasterRecoveryUsingBareos.html#rescuechapter) chapter of this manual.

- Problem

  My database is broken.

- Solution

  See the PostgreSQL documentation. They have specific tools that check and repair databases, see the [Catalog Maintenance](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/CatalogMaintenance.html#catmaintenancechapter) sections of this manual for links to vendor information. Assuming the above does not resolve the problem, you will need to  restore or rebuild your catalog. Note, if it is a matter of some  inconsistencies in the Bareos tables rather than a broken database, then running [bareos-dbcheck](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/BareosPrograms.html#bareos-dbcheck) might help, but you will need to ensure that your database indexes are properly setup.

- Problem

  How do I restore my catalog?

- Solution with a Catalog backup

  If you have backed up your database nightly (as you should) and you have made a bootstrap file,  you can immediately load back your database (or the ASCII SQL output).  Make a copy of your current database, then re-initialize it, by running  the following scripts: `/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/drop_bareos_tables /usr/lib/bareos/scripts/make_bareos_tables `

After re-initializing the  database, you should be able to run Bareos. If you now try to use the  restore command, it will not work because the database will be empty.  However, you can manually run a restore job and specify your bootstrap  file. You do so by entering the run command in the console and selecting the restore job. If you are using the default Bareos Director  configuration, this Job will be named RestoreFiles. Most likely it will  prompt you with something such as:

```
Run Restore job
JobName:    RestoreFiles
Bootstrap:  /home/user/bareos/working/restore.bsr
Where:      /tmp/bareos-restores
Replace:    always
FileSet:    Full Set
Client:     bareos-fd
Storage:    File
When:       2012-12-12 17:33:40
Catalog:    MyCatalog
Priority:   10
OK to run? (yes/mod/no):
```

A number of the items will be different in your case. What you want to do is: to use the mod option to change the  Bootstrap to point to your saved bootstrap file; and to make sure all  the other items such as Client, Storage, Catalog, and Where are correct. The FileSet is not used when you specify a bootstrap file. Once you  have set all the correct values, run the Job and it will restore the  backup of your database, which is most likely an ASCII dump.

You will then need to follow the instructions for your database type  to recreate the database from the ASCII backup file. See the [Catalog Maintenance](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/CatalogMaintenance.html#catmaintenancechapter) chapter of this manual for examples of the command needed to restore a  database from an ASCII dump (they are shown in the Compacting Your XXX  Database sections).

Also, please note that after you restore your database from an ASCII  backup, you do NOT want to do a make_bareos_tables command, or you will  probably erase your newly restored database tables.

Solution with a Job listing

If you did save your database but did not make a bootstrap file, then recovering the database is more difficult. You will probably need to use **bextract** to extract the backup copy. First you should locate the listing of the  job report from the last catalog backup. It has important information  that will allow you to quickly find your database file. For example, in  the job report for the CatalogBackup shown below, the critical items are the Volume name(s), the Volume Session Id and the Volume Session Time. If you know those, you can  easily restore your Catalog.

From the above information, you can manually  create a bootstrap file, and then follow the instructions given above  for restoring your database. A reconstructed bootstrap file for the  above backup Job would look like the following:

```
Volume="DLT-22Apr15"
VolSessionId=11
VolSessionTime=1429607926
FileIndex=1-1
```

Where we have inserted the Volume name, Volume  Session Id, and Volume Session Time that correspond to the values in the job report. We’ve also used a FileIndex of one, which will always be  the case providing that there was only one file backed up in the job.

The disadvantage of this bootstrap file compared to what is created  when you ask for one to be written, is that there is no File and Block  specified, so the restore code must search all data in the Volume to  find the requested file. A fully specified bootstrap file would have the File and Blocks specified as follows:

```
Volume="DLT-22Apr15"
VolSessionId=11
VolSessionTime=1429607926
VolFile=118-118
VolBlock=0-4053
FileIndex=1-1
```

Once you have restored the ASCII dump of the  database, you will then to follow the instructions for your database  type to recreate the database from the ASCII backup file. See the [Catalog Maintenance](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/CatalogMaintenance.html#catmaintenancechapter) chapter of this manual for examples of the command needed to restore a  database from an ASCII dump (they are shown in the Compacting Your XXX  Database sections).

Also, please note that after you restore your database from an ASCII  backup, you do NOT want to do a make_bareos_tables command, or you will  probably erase your newly restored database tables.

Solution without a Job Listing

If you do not have a job listing, then it is a bit more difficult. Either you use the [bscan](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/BareosPrograms.html#bscan) program to scan the contents of your tape into a database, which can be very time consuming depending on the size of the tape, or you can use  the [bls](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/BareosPrograms.html#bls) program to list everything on the tape, and reconstruct a bootstrap  file from the bls listing for the file or files you want following the  instructions given above.

There is a specific example of how to use bls below.

Problem

Trying to restore the last known good full backup by specifying item 3 on the restore menu then the JobId to restore, but Bareos then reports:

```
1 Job 0 Files
```

and restores nothing.

Solution

Most likely the File records were pruned from  the database either due to the File Retention period expiring or by  explicitly purging the Job. By using the “llist jobid=nn” command, you  can obtain all the important information about the job:

```
llist jobid=120
           JobId: 120
             Job: save.2005-12-05_18.27.33
        Job.Name: save
     PurgedFiles: 0
            Type: B
           Level: F
    Job.ClientId: 1
     Client.Name: Rufus
       JobStatus: T
       SchedTime: 2005-12-05 18:27:32
       StartTime: 2005-12-05 18:27:35
         EndTime: 2005-12-05 18:27:37
        JobTDate: 1133803657
    VolSessionId: 1
  VolSessionTime: 1133803624
        JobFiles: 236
       JobErrors: 0
 JobMissingFiles: 0
      Job.PoolId: 4
       Pool.Name: Full
   Job.FileSetId: 1
 FileSet.FileSet: BackupSet
```

Then you can find the Volume(s) used by doing:

```
sql
select VolumeName from JobMedia,Media where JobId=1 and JobMedia.MediaId=Media.MediaId;
```

Finally, you can create a bootstrap file as described in the previous problem above using this information.

Bareos will ask you if you would like to restore all the files in the job, and it will collect the above information and write the bootstrap  file for you.

Problem

You don’t have a bootstrap file, and you don’t  have the Job report for the backup of your database, but you did backup  the database, and you know the Volume to which it was backed up.

Solution

Either **bscan** the tape (see below for bscanning), or better use **bls** to find where it is on the tape, then use **bextract** to restore the database. For example,

```
./bls -j -V DLT-22Apr15 /dev/nst0
```

Might produce the following output:

```
bls: butil.c:258 Using device: "/dev/nst0" for reading.
21-Jul 18:34 bls: Ready to read from volume "DLT-22Apr15" on device "DLTDrive"
(/dev/nst0).
Volume Record: File:blk=0:0 SessId=11 SessTime=1429607926 JobId=0 DataLen=164
...
Begin Job Session Record: File:blk=118:0 SessId=11 SessTime=1429607926
JobId=7510
   Job=CatalogBackup.2015-04-22_01.10.0 Date=22-Apr-2015 10:21:00 Level=F Type=B
End Job Session Record: File:blk=118:4053 SessId=11 SessTime=1429607926
JobId=7510
   Date=22-Apr-2005 10:23:06 Level=F Type=B Files=1 Bytes=210,739,395 Errors=0
Status=T
...
21-Jul 18:34 bls: End of Volume at file 201 on device "DLTDrive" (/dev/nst0),
Volume "DLT-22Apr15"
21-Jul 18:34 bls: End of all volumes.
```

Of course, there will be many more records  printed, but we have indicated the essential lines of output. From the  information on the Begin Job and End Job Session Records, you can  reconstruct a bootstrap file such as the one shown above.

Problem

How can I find where a file is stored?

Solution

Normally, it is not necessary, you just use the  restore command to restore the most recently saved version (menu option  5), or a version saved before a given date (menu option 8). If you know  the JobId of the job in which it was saved, you can use menu option 3 to enter that JobId.

If you would like to know the JobId where a file was saved, select restore menu option 2.

You can also use the query command to find information such as:

```
*query
Available queries:
     1: List up to 20 places where a File is saved regardless of the
directory
     2: List where the most recent copies of a file are saved
     3: List last 20 Full Backups for a Client
     4: List all backups for a Client after a specified time
     5: List all backups for a Client
     6: List Volume Attributes for a selected Volume
     7: List Volumes used by selected JobId
     8: List Volumes to Restore All Files
     9: List Pool Attributes for a selected Pool
    10: List total files/bytes by Job
    11: List total files/bytes by Volume
    12: List Files for a selected JobId
    13: List Jobs stored on a selected MediaId
    14: List Jobs stored for a given Volume name
    15: List Volumes Bareos thinks are in changer
    16: List Volumes likely to need replacement from age or errors
Choose a query (1-16):
```

Problem

I didn’t backup my database. What do I do now?

Solution

This is probably the worst of all cases, and you will probably have to re-create your database from scratch and then  bscan in all your volumes, which is a very long, painful, and inexact  process.

There are basically three steps to take:

1. Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and that the Bareos database (normally bareos) exists. See the [Prepare Bareos database](https://docs.bareos.org/IntroductionAndTutorial/InstallingBareos.html#section-createdatabase) chapter of the manual.
2. Ensure that the Bareos databases are created. This is also described at the above link.
3. Start and stop the Bareos Director using the probate Bareos  Director configuration files so that it can create the Client and  Storage records which are not stored on the Volumes. Without these  records, scanning is unable to connect the Job records to the proper  client.

When the above is complete, you can begin bscanning your Volumes.
