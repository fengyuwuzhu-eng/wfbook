# 卷管理

[TOC]

## 概述

介绍了卷管理所需的几乎所有功能。大多数概念同样适用于磁带和磁盘存储器。

如果有大量的硬盘存储，或者绝对必须在一个小的时间窗口内运行备份，可能希望将 Bareos 备份到磁盘磁盘，而不是磁带。

## 关键概念和资源记录

在最简单的情况下，让 Bareos 写入磁盘而不是磁带相当容易。在 Storage 守护进程的配置文件中，只需将 `Archive Device` 定义为一个目录。在磁盘上存储备份的默认目录是 `/var/lib/bareos/storage` ：

```bash
Device {
  Name = FileBackup
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /var/lib/bareos/storage
  Random Access = Yes;
  AutomaticMount = yes;
  RemovableMedia = no;
  AlwaysOpen = no;
}
```

假设您的 Director 配置文件中有引用上述设备资源的相应 `Storage (Dir)` 资源，

```bash
Storage {
  Name = FileStorage
  Address = ...
  Password = ...
  Device = FileBackup
  Media Type = File
}
```

然后，Bareos 会将归档文件写入文件 `/var/lib/bareos/storage/<volume-name>` ，其中 `<volume-name>` 是池中定义的卷的卷名。例如，如果标记了一个名为 `Vol001` 的卷，Bareos 将写入文件 `/var/lib/bareos/storage/Vol001` 。虽然您可以稍后将存档文件移动到另一个目录，但您不应该重命名它，否则它将无法被 Bareos 读取。这是因为每个归档文件都有文件名作为内部标签的一部分，内部标签必须与系统文件名一致，然后 Bareos 才会使用它。

虽然这很简单，但存在一些问题。第一个是，除非您另行指定，否则 Bareos 将始终写入同一个卷，直到磁盘空间耗尽。

此外，如果希望使用同时写入多个不同卷的并发作业，则需要了解许多其他细节。

### 限制卷使用的池选项

您拥有的一些选项（所有选项都在池记录中指定）包括：

- `Maximum Volume Jobs (Dir->Pool)` ：在每个卷上只写入指定数量的作业。

- `Maximum Volume Bytes (Dir->Pool)` ：限制每个卷的最大大小。

  请注意，如果使用磁盘卷，可能应该将卷大小限制为某个合理的值。如果曾经有过部分硬盘故障，如果它们位于较小的磁盘中，则更有可能恢复更多数据。

- `Volume Use Duration (Dir->Pool)` ：限制第一个和最后一个数据写入卷之间的时间。

请注意，尽管您可能不想像在磁盘卷上那样限制磁带上的字节数，但其他选项在限制 Bareos 使用特定卷（无论是磁带还是磁盘）的时间方面非常有用。例如，如果您愿意，上述指令可以允许您确保在一组每日卷中轮换。

如上所述，每个用于卷的指令都是在一个或多个池中指定的。在 `Maximum Volume Jobs (Dir->Pool)`  、`Maximum Volume Bytes (Dir->Pool)` 和 `Volume Use Duration (Dir->Pool)` 的情况下，实际上可以逐个卷指定所需的值。标记新卷时，池记录中指定的值将成为默认值。一旦创建了卷，它就会获得自己的池默认值副本，随后更改池将不会对现有卷产生影响。可以手动更改卷值，也可以使用控制台中的 `update Volume` 命令从池默认值中刷新它们。作为使用上述方法之一的示例，假设您的 Pool 资源包含：

```bash
Pool {
  Name = File
  Pool Type = Backup
  Volume Use Duration = 23h
}
```

如果每天运行一次备份（每 24 小时），Bareos 将为每次备份使用一个新的卷，因为它写入的每个卷只能在第一次写入后使用 23 小时。请注意，对于磁带，将使用持续时间设置为 23 小时并不是一个很好的解决方案，除非周末有人在现场。因为 Bareos 需要一个新的卷，且没有人在场来装载它，所以直到星期一早上才会进行周末备份。 

### 自动卷标签

使用上述记录会带来另一个问题，即标记卷。对于自动磁盘备份，可以手动标记每个卷，也可以让 Bareos 在需要时自动标记新卷。

请注意，自动卷标签也可以用于磁带，但它不是那么实用，因为磁带必须预先安装。这需要一些用户交互。来自模板的自动标签不适用于自动转换器，因为 Bareos 不会访问未知插槽。

通过对 `Pool (Dir)` 资源和 `Device (Sd)` 资源进行如上所示的更改，可以启用自动卷标记。在 Pool 资源的情况下，必须为 Bareos 提供一个标签格式，该格式将用于创建新名称。在最简单的形式中，标签格式只是卷名，Bareos 会在卷名上附加一个四位数。此编号从 0001 开始，并针对目录包含的每个卷递增。因此，如果将池资源修改为：

```bash
Pool {
  Name = File
  Pool Type = Backup
  Volume Use Duration = 23h
  Label Format = "Vol"
}
```

当需要新卷时，Bareos 将创建卷名 Vol0001、Vol0002 等。

使自动标记工作所需的第二项更改是授予 Storage 守护程序自动标记卷的权限。通过将 `Label Media = yes` 添加到 `Device (Sd)` 资源来执行此操作，如下所示：

```bash
Device {
  Name = File
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /var/lib/bareos/storage/
  Random Access = yes
  Automatic Mount = yes
  Removable Media = no
  Always Open = no
  Label Media = yes
}
```

### 限制卷数和回收

上面讨论的自动标记提出了卷管理的问题。使用上述方案，每天都会创建一个新的卷。如果没有指定保留期，目录将继续填充并跟踪 Bareos 备份的所有文件，此过程将每天创建一个新的存档文件（卷）。

Bareos 提供的帮助自动管理这些问题的工具如下：

- `Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)`

- `Auto Prune (Dir->Pool)= yes` ：允许应用 [`Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_VolumeRetention) 周期。

- `Recycle (Dir->Pool) = yes` ：允许自动回收卷保留期已到期的卷。

- `Recycle Oldest Volume (Dir->Pool) = yes` ：删除池中最旧的卷，如果删除了所有文件，则回收此卷并使用它。

- `Recycle Current Volume (Dir->Pool) = yes`：修剪池中当前装入的卷，如果所有文件都被修剪，则回收该卷并使用它。

- `Purge Oldest Volume (Dir->Pool) = yes`：允许在需要新卷时强制回收最旧的卷。

  > **Warning：**
  >
  > 此记录忽略保留期！我们高度建议不要使用此记录，而是使用 `Recycle Oldest Volume (Dir->Pool)` 。
  >

- `Maximum Volumes (Dir->Pool)` ：限制可以创建卷的数量。

`Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)` ，`Auto Prune (Dir->Pool)` 和 `Recycle (Dir->Pool)` 决定了 Bareos 在重新使用卷之前将保留其多长时间。

`Maximum Volumes (Dir->Pool)` 记录也可以与 `Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)` 期限结合使用，以限制 Bareos 将创建的归档容量的总数。通过设置一个适当的 `Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)` 期间，a Volume will be purged just before it is needed and thus  Bareos can cycle through a fixed set of Volumes.一个卷将被清除之前，它是需要的，因此Bareos可以通过一个固定的磁盘集循环。 Cycling through a fixed set of Volumes can also be done by setting [`Purge Oldest Volume (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_PurgeOldestVolume) = yes or [`Recycle Current Volume (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_RecycleCurrentVolume) = yes. 也可以通过设置“循环最旧卷（目录->池）”= yes或“循环当前卷（目录->池）”= yes来完成循环通过固定的卷集。在这种情况下，当 Bareos 需要一个新的卷时，它将修剪指定的卷。

## 并发磁盘作业

we discussed how you could have a single device named `FileBackup (Sd->Device)` that writes to volumes in `/var/lib/bareos/storage/`. 上面，我们讨论了如何使用名为 `FileBackup (Sd->Device)` 的单个设备来写入 `/var/lib/bareos/storage/` 中的卷。事实上，可以使用本例中给出的存储定义运行多个并发作业，并且所有作业都将同时写入正在写入的卷中。

现在假设想要使用多个池，这意味着多个卷，或者假设希望每个客户端都有自己的卷，也许还有自己的目录，如 /home/bareos/client1 和 /home/bereos/client2 。对于上面的单个存储和设备定义，这两者都不可能实现。因为 Bareos 磁盘存储遵循与磁带设备相同的规则。在任何时间，任何设备上只能装载一个卷。如果您想同时写入多个卷，则需要在 Bareos Storage Daemon 配置中使用多个设备资源，因此需要在 Bareos Director 配置中使用多种存储资源。

现在应该明白，在不同目录或不同池的情况下，你需要多个设备定义，但你也需要知道 Bareos 保存的目录数据只包含介质类型，而不包含特定的存储设备。这允许在任何兼容的磁带驱动器上重新读取磁带。兼容性由介质类型 `Media Type (Dir->Storage)` 和 `Media Type (Sd->Device)` 决定。磁盘存储也是如此。Since a volume that is written by a Device in say directory `/home/bareos/backups` cannot be read by a Device with an [`Archive Device (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_ArchiveDevice) = `/home/bareos/client1`, you will not be able to restore all your files if you give both those devices [`Media Type (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_MediaType) = File.由于由目录/home/bareos/backups中的设备写入的卷无法由具有存档设备（Sd->Device）=/home/bereos/client1的设备读取，因此如果您将这两个设备都设置为Media Type（Sd->Device）=File，则您将无法还原所有文件。It does not know the [`Archive Device (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_ArchiveDevice) (or the full path) that is specified in the Bareos Storage Daemon. 在恢复过程中，Bareos 只会选择第一个可用的设备，但可能不是正确的设备。如果这令人困惑，请记住目录只有介质类型和卷名。它不知道Bareos存储守护程序中指定的存档设备（Sd->Device）（或完整路径）。因此，必须使用介质类型将卷明确地绑定到正确的设备。

### Example for two clients, separate devices and recycling两个客户端、独立设备和回收处理的示例

下面的示例不是很实用，but can be used to  demonstrate the proof of concept in a relatively short period of time.但可以用来在相对较短的时间内演示概念证明。

The example consists of a two clients that are backed up to a set of  12 Volumes for each client into different directories on the Storage  machine. 该示例包含两个客户端，每个客户端备份到存储计算机上的不同目录中的一组12个磁盘。每个卷只被使用（写入）一次，每小时有四次完整保存（所以整个事情在三个小时后循环）。

这里的关键是 Bareos Storage Daemon 上的每个物理设备都有不同的媒体类型。这使 Director 可以选择正确的设备进行恢复。

Bareos Director 配置如下：

```bash
Director {
  Name = bareos-dir
  QueryFile = "/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/query.sql"
  Password = "<secret>"
}

Schedule {
  Name = "FourPerHour"
  Run = Level=Full hourly at 0:05
  Run = Level=Full hourly at 0:20
  Run = Level=Full hourly at 0:35
  Run = Level=Full hourly at 0:50
}

FileSet {
  Name = "Example FileSet"
  Include {
    Options {
      compression = LZ4
      signature = XXH128
    }
    File = /etc
  }
}

Job {
  Name = "RecycleExample"
  Type = Backup
  Level = Full
  Client = client1-fd
  FileSet= "Example FileSet"
  Messages = Standard
  Storage = FileStorage
  Pool = Recycle
  Schedule = FourPerHour
}

Job {
  Name = "RecycleExample2"
  Type = Backup
  Level = Full
  Client = client2-fd
  FileSet= "Example FileSet"
  Messages = Standard
  Storage = FileStorage2
  Pool = Recycle2
  Schedule = FourPerHour
}

Client {
  Name = client1-fd
  Address = client1.example.com
  Password = client1_password
}

Client {
  Name = client2-fd
  Address = client2.example.com
  Password = client2_password
}

Storage {
  Name = FileStorage
  Address = bareos-sd.example.com
  Password = local_storage_password
  Device = RecycleDir
  Media Type = File
}

Storage {
  Name = FileStorage2
  Address = bareos-sd.example.com
  Password = local_storage_password
  Device = RecycleDir2
  Media Type = File1
}

Catalog {
  Name = MyCatalog
  ...
}

Messages {
  Name = Standard
  ...
}

Pool {
  Name = Recycle
  Pool Type = Backup
  Label Format = "Recycle-"
  Auto Prune = yes
  Use Volume Once = yes
  Volume Retention = 2h
  Maximum Volumes = 12
  Recycle = yes
}

Pool {
  Name = Recycle2
  Pool Type = Backup
  Label Format = "Recycle2-"
  Auto Prune = yes
  Use Volume Once = yes
  Volume Retention = 2h
  Maximum Volumes = 12
  Recycle = yes
}
```

Bareos Storage Daemon 配置为：

```bash
Storage {
  Name = bareos-sd
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 10
}

Director {
  Name = bareos-dir
  Password = local_storage_password
}

Device {
  Name = RecycleDir
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /home/bareos/backups
  LabelMedia = yes;
  Random Access = Yes;
  AutomaticMount = yes;
  RemovableMedia = no;
  AlwaysOpen = no;
}

Device {
  Name = RecycleDir2
  Media Type = File2
  Archive Device = /home/bareos/backups2
  LabelMedia = yes;
  Random Access = Yes;
  AutomaticMount = yes;
  RemovableMedia = no;
  AlwaysOpen = no;
}

Messages {
  Name = Standard
  director = bareos-dir = all
}
```

With a little bit of work, you can change the above example into a  weekly or monthly cycle (take care about the amount of archive disk  space used).通过一些工作，可以将上面的示例更改为每周或每月周期（注意归档磁盘空间的使用量）。

### Using Multiple Storage Devices

Bareos treats disk volumes similar to tape volumes as much as it can. Bareos 尽可能地将磁盘卷视为类似于磁带卷。you can only have a single Volume mounted at one time  on a disk as defined in your `Device (Sd)` resource.这意味着您只能有一个单一的卷挂载在一个磁盘上的定义在您的设备（Sd）资源。

If you use Bareos without [Data Spooling](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/DataSpooling.html#section-dataspooling), multiple concurrent backup jobs can be written to a Volume using interleaving. 如果您使用 Bareos 而不使用数据假脱机，则可以使用交错将多个并发备份作业写入卷。但是，交错也有缺点。

Also the `Device (Sd)` will be in use. `Device (Sd)` 也将使用。如果有其他工作，请求其他的卷，这些工作必须等待。

在磁带（或自动转换器）上，这是硬件的物理限制。但是，当使用磁盘存储时，这只是软件的限制。

要使 Bareos 能够运行并发作业（在磁盘存储上），define as many `Device (Sd)` as concurrent jobs should run. 请定义并发作业应运行的设备（Sd）数量。所有这些 `Device (Sd)` 可以使用相同的 [`Archive Device (Sd->Device)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/StorageDaemon.html#config-Sd_Device_ArchiveDevice) 目录。为所有这些设备设置 `Maximum Concurrent Jobs (Sd->Device) = 1`  。

#### 示例：使用指向同一目录的四个存储设备

```bash
Director {
  Name = bareos-dir.example.com
  QueryFile = "/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/query.sql"
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 10
  Password = "<secret>"
}

Storage {
  Name = File
  Address = bareos-sd.bareos.com
  Password = "<sd-secret>"
  Device = FileStorage1
  Device = FileStorage2
  Device = FileStorage3
  Device = FileStorage4
  # number of devices = Maximum Concurrent Jobs
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 4
  Media Type = File
}

[...]
```

Bareos Storage Daemon 配置: using 4 storage devices

```bash
Storage {
  Name = bareos-sd.example.com
  # any number >= 4
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 20
}

Director {
  Name = bareos-dir.example.com
  Password = "<sd-secret>"
}

Device {
  Name = FileStorage1
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /var/lib/bareos/storage
  LabelMedia = yes
  Random Access = yes
  AutomaticMount = yes
  RemovableMedia = no
  AlwaysOpen = no
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
}

Device {
  Name = FileStorage2
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /var/lib/bareos/storage
  LabelMedia = yes
  Random Access = yes
  AutomaticMount = yes
  RemovableMedia = no
  AlwaysOpen = no
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
}

Device {
  Name = FileStorage3
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /var/lib/bareos/storage
  LabelMedia = yes
  Random Access = yes
  AutomaticMount = yes
  RemovableMedia = no
  AlwaysOpen = no
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
}

Device {
  Name = FileStorage4
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /var/lib/bareos/storage
  LabelMedia = yes
  Random Access = yes
  AutomaticMount = yes
  RemovableMedia = no
  AlwaysOpen = no
  Maximum Concurrent Jobs = 1
}
```

## 自动卷回收

默认情况下，一旦 Bareos 开始写一个卷，它可以附加到卷，但它不会覆盖现有的数据，从而销毁它。然而，当 Bareos 回收一个卷，该卷成为可供重用，Bareos 可以在稍后的时间覆盖该卷以前的内容。所有以前的数据都将丢失。如果卷是一个磁带，则磁带将从头重写。如果卷是一个磁盘文件，该文件将在重写之前被截断。

您可能不希望 Bareos 自动回收（重复使用）磁带。这将需要大量的磁带，但在这种情况下，可以手动回收磁带。

大多数人更喜欢有一个磁带池，用于每日备份，每周回收一次；另一个磁带池，用于每周完整备份，每月回收一次；最后一个磁带池，每月使用一次，一两年后回收。使用这样的方案，池中的磁带数量保持不变。

By properly defining your Volume Pools with appropriate Retention  periods,通过正确地定义卷回收与适当的保留期，Bareos 可以自动管理回收（如上面定义的）。

自动回收存储器由池（Dir）资源定义中的四个记录控制。这四个记录是：

Automatic recycling of Volumes is controlled by four records in the `Pool (Dir)` resource definition. These four records are:

- [`Auto Prune (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_AutoPrune) = yes
- [`Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_VolumeRetention)
- [`Recycle (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_Recycle) = yes
- [`Recycle Pool (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_RecyclePool)

The above three directives are all you need assuming that you fill  each of your Volumes then wait the Volume Retention period before  reusing them. If you want Bareos to stop using a Volume and recycle it  before it is full, you can use one or more additional directives such  as:

- [`Volume Use Duration (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_VolumeUseDuration)
- [`Maximum Volume Jobs (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_MaximumVolumeJobs)
- [`Maximum Volume Bytes (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_MaximumVolumeBytes)

Please see below and the [Basic Volume Management](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/VolumeManagement.html#diskchapter) chapter of this manual for complete examples.

Automatic recycling of Volumes is performed by Bareos only when it  wants a new Volume and no appendable Volumes are available in the Pool.  It will then search the Pool for any Volumes with the Recycle flag set  and the Volume Status is **Purged**. At that point, it will choose the oldest purged volume and recycle it.

If there are no volumes with status **Purged**, then the recycling occurs in two steps:

1. The Catalog for a Volume must be pruned of all Jobs (i.e. Purged).
2. The actual recycling of the Volume.

Only Volumes marked **Full** or **Used** will be considerd for pruning. The Volume will be purged if the **Volume Retention** period has expired. When a Volume is marked as **Purged**, it means that no Catalog records reference that Volume and the Volume can be recycled.

Until recycling actually occurs, the Volume data remains intact. If  no Volumes can be found for recycling for any of the reasons stated  above, Bareos will request operator intervention (i.e. it will ask you  to label a new volume).

A key point mentioned above, that can be a source of frustration, is  that Bareos will only recycle purged Volumes if there is no other  appendable Volume available. Otherwise, it will always write to an  appendable Volume before recycling even if there are Volume marked as  Purged. This preserves your data as long as possible. So, if you wish to “force” Bareos to use a purged Volume, you must first ensure that no  other Volume in the Pool is marked Append. If necessary, you can manually set a volume to Full. The reason for this is that Bareos wants  to preserve the data on your old tapes (even though purged from the  catalog) as long as absolutely possible before overwriting it. There are also a number of directives such as **Volume Use Duration** that will automatically mark a volume as **Used** and thus no longer appendable.



### Automatic Pruning



As Bareos writes files to tape, it keeps a list of files, jobs, and  volumes in a database called the catalog. Among other things, the  database helps Bareos to decide which files to back up in an incremental or differential backup, and helps you locate files on past backups when you want to restore something. However, the catalog will grow larger  and larger as time goes on, and eventually it can become unacceptably  large.

Bareos’s process for removing entries from the catalog is called  Pruning. The default is Automatic Pruning, which means that once an  entry reaches a certain age (e.g. 30 days old) it is removed from the  catalog. Note that Job records that are required for current restore and File records are needed for VirtualFull and Accurate backups won’t be  removed automatically.

Once a job has been pruned, you can still restore it from the backup  tape, but one additional step is required: scanning the volume with **bscan**.

The alternative to Automatic Pruning is Manual Pruning, in which you  explicitly tell Bareos to erase the catalog entries for a volume. You’d  usually do this when you want to reuse a Bareos volume, because there’s  no point in keeping a list of files that USED TO BE on a tape. Or, if  the catalog is starting to get too big, you could prune the oldest jobs  to save space. Manual pruning is done with the [prune command](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/BareosConsole.html#manualpruning) in the console.

### Pruning Directives



There are three pruning durations. All apply to catalog database  records and not to the actual data in a Volume. The pruning (or  retention) durations are for: Volumes (Media records), Jobs (Job  records), and Files (File records). The durations inter-depend because  if Bareos prunes a Volume, it automatically removes all the Job records, and all the File records. Also when a Job record is pruned, all the  File records for that Job are also pruned (deleted) from the catalog.

Having the File records in the database means that you can examine  all the files backed up for a particular Job. They take the most space  in the catalog (probably 90-95% of the total). When the File records are pruned, the Job records can remain, and you can still examine what Jobs ran, but not the details of the Files backed up. In addition, without  the File records, you cannot use the Console restore command to restore  the files.

When a Job record is pruned, the Volume (Media record) for that Job can still remain in the database, and if you do a **list volumes**, you will see the volume information, but the Job records (and its File records) will no longer be available.

In each case, pruning removes information about where older files  are, but it also prevents the catalog from growing to be too large. You  choose the retention periods in function of how many files you are  backing up and the time periods you want to keep those records online,  and the size of the database. It is possible to re-insert the records  (with 98% of the original data) by using **bscan** to scan in a whole Volume or any part of the volume that you want.

By setting [`Auto Prune (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_AutoPrune) = yes you will permit the Bareos Director to automatically prune all  Volumes in the Pool when a Job needs another Volume. Volume pruning  means removing records from the catalog. It does not shrink the size of  the Volume or affect the Volume data until the Volume gets overwritten.  When a Job requests another volume and there are no Volumes with Volume  status **Append** available, Bareos will begin volume pruning. This means that all Jobs that are older than the **Volume Retention** period will be pruned from every Volume that has Volume status **Full** or **Used** and has **Recycle = yes**. Pruning consists of deleting the corresponding Job, File, and JobMedia  records from the catalog database. No change to the physical data on the Volume occurs during the pruning process. When all files are pruned from a Volume (i.e. no records in the catalog), the  Volume will be marked as **Purged** implying that no Jobs remain on the volume. The Pool records that control the pruning are described below.

- [`Auto Prune (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_AutoPrune) = yes

  when running a Job and it needs a new Volume but no appendable volumes are available, apply the Volume retention period. At that point, Bareos will prune all Volumes that can be pruned in an  attempt to find a usable volume. If during the autoprune, all files are  pruned from the Volume, it will be marked with Volume status **Purged**. Note, that although the File and Job records may be pruned from the catalog, a Volume will only be marked **Purged** (and hence ready for recycling) if the Volume status is **Append**, **Full**, **Used**, or **Error**. If the Volume has another status, such as **Archive**, **Read-Only**, **Disabled**, **Busy** or **Cleaning**, the Volume status will not be changed to **Purged**.

- [`Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_VolumeRetention)

  defines the length of time that Bareos will  guarantee that the Volume is not reused counting from the time the last  job stored on the Volume terminated. A key point is that this time  period is not even considered as long at the Volume remains appendable.  The Volume Retention period count down begins only when the **Append** status has been changed to some other status (**Full**, **Used**, **Purged**, …). When this time period expires and if [`Auto Prune (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_AutoPrune) = yes and a new Volume is needed, but no appendable Volume is  available, Bareos will prune (remove) Job records that are older than  the specified **Volume Retention** period. The **Volume Retention** period takes precedence over any [`Job Retention (Dir->Client)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Client_JobRetention) period you have specified in the Client resource. It should also be noted, that the **Volume Retention** period is obtained by reading the Catalog Database Media record rather  than the Pool resource record. This means that if you change the [`Volume Retention (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_VolumeRetention) in the Pool resource record, you must ensure that the corresponding change is made in the catalog by using the **update pool** command. Doing so will insure that any new Volumes will be created with the changed **Volume Retention** period. Any existing Volumes will have their own copy of the **Volume Retention** period that can only be changed on a Volume by Volume basis using the **update volume** command. When all file catalog entries are removed from the volume, its Volume status is set to **Purged**. The files remain physically on the Volume until the volume is overwritten.

- [`Recycle (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_Recycle)

  defines whether or not the particular Volume can be recycled (i.e. rewritten). If Recycle is set to **no**, then even if Bareos prunes all the Jobs on the volume and it is marked **Purged**, it will not consider the tape for recycling. If Recycle is set to **yes** and all Jobs have been pruned, the volume status will be set to **Purged** and the volume may then be reused when another volume is needed. If the volume is reused, it is relabeled with the same Volume Name, however all previous data will be lost.

### Recycling Algorithm



After all Volumes of a Pool have been pruned (as mentioned above, this happens when a Job needs a new Volume and no appendable Volumes are available), Bareos  will look for the oldest Volume that is **Purged** (all Jobs and Files expired), and if the **Recycle = yes** for that Volume, Bareos will relabel it and write new data on it.

As mentioned above, there are two key points for getting a Volume to be recycled. First, the Volume must no longer be marked **Append** (there are a number of directives to automatically make this change),  and second since the last write on the Volume, one or more of the  Retention periods must have expired so that there are no more catalog  backup job records that reference that Volume. Once both those  conditions are satisfied, the volume can be marked **Purged** and hence recycled.

The full algorithm that Bareos uses when it needs a new Volume is:  

The algorithm described below assumes that **Auto Prune** is enabled, that Recycling is turned on, and that you have defined  appropriate Retention periods or used the defaults for all these items.

1. If the request is for an Autochanger device, look only for Volumes  in the Autochanger (i.e. with InChanger set and that have the correct  Storage device).
2. Search the Pool for a Volume with Volume status=**Append** (if there is more than one, the Volume with the oldest date last written is  chosen. If two have the same date then the one with the lowest MediaId  is chosen).
3. Search the Pool for a Volume with Volume status=**Recycle** and the  InChanger flag is set true (if there is more than one, the Volume with  the oldest date last written is chosen. If two have the same date then  the one with the lowest MediaId is chosen).
4. Try recycling any purged Volumes.
5. Prune volumes applying Volume retention period (Volumes with  VolStatus Full, Used, or Append are pruned). Note, even if all the File  and Job records are pruned from a Volume, the Volume will not be marked  Purged until the Volume retention period expires.
6. Search the Pool for a Volume with VolStatus=Purged
7. If a Pool named `Scratch (Dir->Pool)` exists, search for a Volume and if found move it to the current Pool  for the Job and use it. Note, when the Scratch Volume is moved into the  current Pool, the basic Pool defaults are applied as if it is a newly  labeled Volume (equivalent to an **update volume from pool** command).
8. If we were looking for Volumes in the Autochanger, go back to step 2 above, but this time, look for any Volume whether or not it is in the  Autochanger.
9. Attempt to create a new Volume if automatic labeling enabled. If the maximum number of Volumes specified for the pool is reached, no new  Volume will be created.
10. Prune the oldest Volume if [`Recycle Oldest Volume (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_RecycleOldestVolume)=yes (the Volume with the oldest LastWritten date and VolStatus equal to  Full, Recycle, Purged, Used, or Append is chosen). This record ensures  that all retention periods are properly respected.
11. Purge the oldest Volume if [`Purge Oldest Volume (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_PurgeOldestVolume)=yes (the Volume with the oldest LastWritten date and VolStatus equal to Full, Recycle, Purged, Used, or Append is chosen).

Warning

- We strongly recommend against the use of **Purge Oldest Volume** as it can quite easily lead to loss of current backup

  data.

1. Give up and ask operator.

The above occurs when Bareos has finished writing a Volume or when no Volume is present in the drive.

On the other hand, if you have inserted a different Volume after the  last job, and Bareos recognizes the Volume as valid, it will request  authorization from the Director to use this Volume. In this case, if you have set [`Recycle Current Volume (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_RecycleCurrentVolume) = yes and the Volume is marked as Used or Full, Bareos will prune the  volume and if all jobs were removed during the pruning (respecting the  retention periods), the Volume will be recycled and used.

The recycling algorithm in this case is:

- If the Volume status is **Append** or **Recycle**, the volume will be used.
- If [`Recycle Current Volume (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_RecycleCurrentVolume) = yes and the volume is marked **Full** or **Used**, Bareos will prune the volume (applying the retention period). If all Jobs are pruned from the volume, it will be recycled.

This permits users to manually change the Volume every day and load  tapes in an order different from what is in the catalog, and if the  volume does not contain a current copy of your backup data, it will be  used.

A few points from Alan Brown to keep in mind:

- If [`Maximum Volumes (Dir->Pool)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Pool_MaximumVolumes) is not set, Bareos will prefer to demand new volumes over forcibly purging older volumes.
- If volumes become free through pruning and the Volume retention period has expired, then they get marked as **Purged** and are immediately available for recycling - these will be used in preference to creating new volumes.

### Recycle Status



Each Volume inherits the Recycle status (yes or no) from the Pool  resource record when the Media record is created (normally when the  Volume is labeled). This Recycle status is stored in the Media record of the Catalog. Using the Console program, you may subsequently change the Recycle status for each Volume. For example in the following output  from list volumes:

```
+----------+-------+--------+---------+------------+--------+-----+
| VolumeNa | Media | VolSta | VolByte | LastWritte | VolRet | Rec |
+----------+-------+--------+---------+------------+--------+-----+
| File0001 | File  | Full   | 4190055 | 2002-05-25 | 14400  | 1   |
| File0002 | File  | Full   | 1896460 | 2002-05-26 | 14400  | 1   |
| File0003 | File  | Full   | 1896460 | 2002-05-26 | 14400  | 1   |
| File0004 | File  | Full   | 1896460 | 2002-05-26 | 14400  | 1   |
| File0005 | File  | Full   | 1896460 | 2002-05-26 | 14400  | 1   |
| File0006 | File  | Full   | 1896460 | 2002-05-26 | 14400  | 1   |
| File0007 | File  | Purged | 1896466 | 2002-05-26 | 14400  | 1   |
+----------+-------+--------+---------+------------+--------+-----+
```

all the volumes are marked as recyclable, and the last Volume,  File0007 has been purged, so it may be immediately recycled. The other  volumes are all marked recyclable and when their Volume Retention period (14400 seconds or four hours) expires, they will be eligible for  pruning, and possibly recycling. Even though Volume File0007 has been  purged, all the data on the Volume is still recoverable. A purged Volume simply means that there are no entries in the Catalog. Even if the  Volume Status is changed to Recycle, the data on the Volume will be recoverable. The data is lost only when the Volume is re-labeled and re-written.

To modify Volume File0001 so that it cannot be recycled, you use the  update volume pool=File command in the console program, or simply update and Bareos will prompt you for the information.

```
+----------+------+-------+---------+-------------+-------+-----+
| VolumeNa | Media| VolSta| VolByte | LastWritten | VolRet| Rec |
+----------+------+-------+---------+-------------+-------+-----+
| File0001 | File | Full  | 4190055 | 2002-05-25  | 14400 | 0   |
| File0002 | File | Full  | 1897236 | 2002-05-26  | 14400 | 1   |
| File0003 | File | Full  | 1896460 | 2002-05-26  | 14400 | 1   |
| File0004 | File | Full  | 1896460 | 2002-05-26  | 14400 | 1   |
| File0005 | File | Full  | 1896460 | 2002-05-26  | 14400 | 1   |
| File0006 | File | Full  | 1896460 | 2002-05-26  | 14400 | 1   |
| File0007 | File | Purged| 1896466 | 2002-05-26  | 14400 | 1   |
+----------+------+-------+---------+-------------+-------+-----+
```

In this case, File0001 will never be automatically recycled. The same effect can be achieved by setting the Volume Status to Read-Only.

As you have noted, the Volume Status (VolStatus) column in the  catalog database contains the current status of the Volume, which is  normally maintained automatically by Bareos. To give you an idea of some of the values it can take during the life cycle of a Volume, here is a  picture created by Arno Lehmann:

```
A typical volume life cycle is like this:

              because job count or size limit exceeded
      Append  -------------------------------------->  Used/Full
        ^                                                  |
        | First Job writes to        Retention time passed |
        | the volume                   and recycling takes |
        |                                            place |
        |                                                  v
      Recycled <-------------------------------------- Purged
                     Volume is selected for reuse
```

### Daily, Weekly, Monthly Tape Usage Example

This example is meant to show you how one could define a fixed set of volumes that Bareos will rotate through on a regular schedule. There  are an infinite number of such schemes, all of which have various  advantages and disadvantages.

We start with the following assumptions:

- A single tape has more than enough capacity to do a full save.
- There are ten tapes that are used on a daily basis for incremental backups. They are prelabeled Daily1 … Daily10.
- There are four tapes that are used on a weekly basis for full backups. They are labeled Week1 … Week4.
- There are 12 tapes that are used on a monthly basis for full backups. They are numbered Month1 … Month12
- A full backup is done every Saturday evening (tape inserted Friday evening before leaving work).
- No backups are done over the weekend (this is easy to change).
- The first Friday of each month, a Monthly tape is used for the Full backup.
- Incremental backups are done Monday - Friday (actually Tue-Fri mornings).

We start the system by doing a Full save to one of the weekly volumes or one of the monthly volumes. The next morning, we remove the tape and insert a Daily tape. Friday evening, we remove the Daily tape and  insert the next tape in the Weekly series. Monday, we remove the Weekly  tape and re-insert the Daily tape. On the first Friday of the next  month, we insert the next Monthly tape in the series rather than a  Weekly tape, then continue. When a Daily tape finally fills up, Bareos  will request the next one in the series, and the next day when you notice the email  message, you will mount it and Bareos will finish the unfinished  incremental backup.

What does this give? Well, at any point, you will have the last  complete Full save plus several Incremental saves. For any given file  you want to recover (or your whole system), you will have a copy of that file every day for at least the last 14 days. For older versions, you  will have at least three and probably four Friday full saves of that  file, and going back further, you will have a copy of that file made on  the beginning of the month for at least a year.

So you have copies of any file (or your whole system) for at least a  year, but as you go back in time, the time between copies increases from daily to weekly to monthly.

What would the Bareos configuration look like to implement such a scheme?

```
Schedule {
  Name = "NightlySave"
  Run = Level=Full Pool=Monthly 1st sat at 03:05
  Run = Level=Full Pool=Weekly 2nd-5th sat at 03:05
  Run = Level=Incremental Pool=Daily tue-fri at 03:05
}
Job {
  Name = "NightlySave"
  Type = Backup
  Level = Full
  Client = LocalMachine
  FileSet = "File Set"
  Messages = Standard
  Storage = DDS-4
  Pool = Daily
  Schedule = "NightlySave"
}
# Definition of file storage device
Storage {
  Name = DDS-4
  Address = localhost
  SDPort = 9103
  Password = XXXXXXXXXXXXX
  Device = FileStorage
  Media Type = 8mm
}
FileSet {
  Name = "File Set"
  Include {
    Options {
      signature=MD5
    }
    File = fffffffffffffffff
  }
  Exclude  { File=*.o }
}
Pool {
  Name = Daily
  Pool Type = Backup
  AutoPrune = yes
  VolumeRetention = 10d   # recycle in 10 days
  Maximum Volumes = 10
  Recycle = yes
}
Pool {
  Name = Weekly
  Use Volume Once = yes
  Pool Type = Backup
  AutoPrune = yes
  VolumeRetention = 30d  # recycle in 30 days (default)
  Recycle = yes
}
Pool {
  Name = Monthly
  Use Volume Once = yes
  Pool Type = Backup
  AutoPrune = yes
  VolumeRetention = 365d  # recycle in 1 year
  Recycle = yes
}
```



### Automatic Pruning and Recycling Example



Perhaps the best way to understand the various resource records that  come into play during automatic pruning and recycling is to run a Job  that goes through the whole cycle. If you add the following resources to your Director’s configuration file:

```
Schedule {
  Name = "30 minute cycle"
  Run = Level=Full Pool=File Messages=Standard Storage=File
         hourly at 0:05
  Run = Level=Full Pool=File Messages=Standard Storage=File
         hourly at 0:35
}
Job {
  Name = "Filetest"
  Type = Backup
  Level = Full
  Client=XXXXXXXXXX
  FileSet="Test Files"
  Messages = Standard
  Storage = File
  Pool = File
  Schedule = "30 minute cycle"
}
# Definition of file storage device
Storage {
  Name = File
  Address = XXXXXXXXXXX
  SDPort = 9103
  Password = XXXXXXXXXXXXX
  Device = FileStorage
  Media Type = File
}
FileSet {
  Name = "File Set"
  Include {
    Options {
      signature=MD5
    }
    File = fffffffffffffffff
  }
  Exclude  { File=*.o }
}
Pool {
  Name = File
  Use Volume Once = yes
  Pool Type = Backup
  LabelFormat = "File"
  AutoPrune = yes
  VolumeRetention = 4h
  Maximum Volumes = 12
  Recycle = yes
}
```

Where you will need to replace the ffffffffff’s by the appropriate  files to be saved for your configuration. For the FileSet Include,  choose a directory that has one or two megabytes maximum since there  will probably be approximately eight copies of the directory that Bareos will cycle through.

In addition, you will need to add the following to your Storage daemon’s configuration file:

```
Device {
  Name = FileStorage
  Media Type = File
  Archive Device = /tmp
  LabelMedia = yes;
  Random Access = Yes;
  AutomaticMount = yes;
  RemovableMedia = no;
  AlwaysOpen = no;
}
```

With the above resources, Bareos will start a Job every half hour  that saves a copy of the directory you chose to /tmp/File0001 …  /tmp/File0012. After 4 hours, Bareos will start recycling the backup  Volumes (/tmp/File0001 …). You should see this happening in the output  produced. Bareos will automatically create the Volumes (Files) the first time it uses them.

To turn it off, either delete all the resources you’ve added, or simply comment out the Schedule record in the Job resource.



### Manually Recycling Volumes



Although automatic recycling of Volumes is implemented (see the [Automatic Volume Recycling](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/VolumeManagement.html#recyclingchapter) chapter of this manual), you may want to manually force reuse (recycling) of a Volume.

Assuming that you want to keep the Volume name, but you simply want to write new data on the tape, the steps to take are:

- Use the **update volume** command in the Console to ensure that **Recycle = yes**.
- Use the **purge jobs volume** command in the Console to mark the Volume as **Purged**. Check by using **list volumes**.

Once the Volume is marked Purged, it will be recycled the next time a Volume is needed.

If you wish to reuse the tape by giving it a new name, use the **relabel** instead of the **purge** command.

Warning

The **delete** command can be dangerous. Once it is done, to recover the File records, you must either restore your database as it was before the **delete** command or use the [bscan](https://docs.bareos.org/Appendix/BareosPrograms.html#bscan) utility program to scan the tape and recreate the database entries.
