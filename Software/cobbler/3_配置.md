## 配置迁移

Updates to the yaml-settings-file

### 从 3.4.0 开始

- TBD

### 从 3.3.3 开始

- `default_virt_file_size` is now a float as intended.现在是预期的浮点数。
- We added the `proxies` key for first-level Uyuni & SUSE Manager support. 我们为Uyuni和SUSE Manager的第一级支持添加了代理密钥。if you don’t run one of the two solutions or a derivative of it.它是可选的，因此如果不运行两个解决方案之一或其衍生物，则可以忽略它。

### 从 3.3.2 开始

- After community feedback we changed the default of the auto-migration to be disabled. It can be re-enabled via the already known methods `cobbler-settings`-Tool, the settings file key `auto_migrate_settings` and the Daemon flag. We have decided to not change the flag for existing installations.
- 在社区反馈后，将自动迁移的默认设置更改为禁用。它可以通过已知的方法cobbler-settings-Tool，设置文件键auto_migrate_settings和Daemon标志重新启用。我们决定不改变现有设施的标志。

### 从 3.3.1 开始

- 有一个新的设置 `bootloaders_shim_location` 。

### 从 3.3.0 开始

- 将设置 `enable_gpxe` 替换为 `enable_ipxe` 。
- 不推荐使用 `settings.d` 目录 (`/etc/cobbler/settings.d/`) ，未来将删除该目录。
- 有一个名为 `cobbler-settings` 的新 CLI 工具，which can be used to validate and migrate settings files from differente versions and to modify keys in the current settings file. 可用于验证和迁移不同版本的设置文件，并修改当前设置文件中的密钥。此外，可以启用或禁用自动迁移功能。
- 实现了新的设置自动迁移功能，在安装新版本时自动更新设置。旧设置文件的备份将事先在同一文件夹中创建。

### 从 3.2.1 开始

- 要求配置文件的扩展名为 `.yaml` ，以向编辑器指示文件的格式，并遵守 YAML 规范的标准。
- 要求使用 `True` 和 `False` 格式的布尔值。如果有旧的整数风格的布尔值 `1` 和 `0` ，应该尽快转换它们。We may decide in a future version to enforce our new way in a stricter manner. Automatic conversion is only done on a best-effort/available-resources basis.可能会决定在未来的版本中以更严格的方式执行新方式。自动转换仅在尽力而为/可用资源的基础上进行。
- We enforce the types of values to the keys. Additional unexpected keys will throw errors. If you have those used in Cobbler please report this in our issue tracker. We have decided to go this way to be able to rely on the existence of the values. This gives us the freedom to write fewer access checks to the settings without losing stability.
- 将值的类型强加给键。额外的意外键将引发错误。如果你有那些在Cobbler中使用的，请在我们的问题跟踪器中报告。我们已经决定走这条路，以能够依赖的价值观的存在。这使我们可以自由地对设置进行更少的访问检查，而不会失去稳定性。

## 5.2.5. allow_dynamic_settings[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#allow-dynamic-settings)

If `True`, Cobbler will allow settings to be changed dynamically without a restart of the `cobblerd` daemon. You can only change this variable by manually editing the settings file, and you MUST restart `cobblerd` after changing it.

default: `False`

## 5.2.6. always_write_dhcp_entries[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#always-write-dhcp-entries)

## 5.2.7. anamon_enabled[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#anamon-enabled)

By default, installs are *not* set to send installation logs to the Cobbler server. With `anamon_enabled`, automatic installation templates may use the `pre_anamon` snippet to allow remote live monitoring of their installations from the Cobbler server. Installation logs will be stored under `/var/log/cobbler/anamon/`.

Note

This does allow an XML-RPC call to send logs to this directory, without authentication, so enable only if you are ok with this limitation.

default: `False`

## 5.2.8. auth_token_expiration[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#auth-token-expiration)

How long the authentication token is valid for, in seconds.

## 5.2.11. autoinstall_scheme[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#autoinstall-scheme)

This should contain the scheme over which the autoinstall-file is available.

This is setting does not setup your api for HTTPS, it just changes the way the url for your profiles and systems are generated.

Choices:

- `http`
- `https`

default: `http`

## 5.2.12. autoinstall_snippets_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#autoinstall-snippets-dir)

This is a directory of files that Cobbler uses to make templating easier. See the Wiki for more information. Changing this directory should not be required.

default: `/var/lib/cobbler/snippets`

## 5.2.13. autoinstall_templates_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#autoinstall-templates-dir)

This is a directory of files that Cobbler uses to make templating easier. See the Wiki for more information. Changing this directory should not be required.

Set to path where zonefiles of bind/named server are located.

default: `"@@bind_zonefiles@@"`

## 5.2.17. boot_loader_conf_template_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#boot-loader-conf-template-dir)

Location of templates used for boot loader config generation.

default: `"/etc/cobbler/boot_loader_conf"`

## 5.2.18. bootloaders_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#bootloaders-dir)

TODO

## 5.2.19. bootloaders_shim_folder[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#bootloaders-shim-folder)

This [Python Glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) will be responsible for finding the installed shim folder. If you haven’t have shim installed this bootloader link will be skipped. If the Glob is not precise enough a message will be logged and the link will also be skipped.

default: Depending on your distro. See values below.

- (open)SUSE: `"/usr/share/efi/*/"`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `"/usr/lib/shim/"`
- CentOS/Fedora: `"/boot/efi/EFI/*/"`

## 5.2.20. bootloaders_shim_file[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#bootloaders-shim-file)

This is a [Python Regex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) which is responsible to find exactly a single match in all files found by the Python Glob in `bootloaders_shim_folder`. If more or fewer files are found a message will be logged.

default: Depending on your distro. See values below.

- (open)SUSE: `"shim\.efi"`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `"shim*.efi.signed"`
- CentOS/Fedora: `"shim*.efi"`

## 5.2.21. grub2_mod_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#grub2-mod-dir)

TODO

The location where Cobbler searches for GRUB configuration files.

default: `/var/lib/cobbler/grub_config`

## 5.2.26. build_reporting_*[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#build-reporting)

Email out a report when Cobbler finishes installing a system.

- enabled: Set to `true` to turn this feature on
- email: Which addresses to email
- ignorelist: TODO
- sender: Optional
- smtp_server: Used to specify another server for an MTA.
- subject: Use the default subject unless overridden.

defaults:

```
build_reporting_enabled: false
build_reporting_sender: ""
build_reporting_email: [ 'root@localhost' ]
build_reporting_smtp_server: "localhost"
build_reporting_subject: ""
build_reporting_ignorelist: [ "" ]
```

## 5.2.27. buildisodir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#buildisodir)

Used for caching the intermediate files for ISO-Building. You may want to use a SSD, a tmpfs or something which does not persist across reboots and can be easily thrown away but is also fast.

default: `/var/cache/cobbler/buildiso`

## 5.2.28. cheetah_import_whitelist[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#cheetah-import-whitelist)

Cheetah-language autoinstall templates can import Python modules. while this is a useful feature, it is not safe to allow them to import anything they want. This whitelists which modules can be imported through Cheetah. Users can expand this as needed but should never allow modules such as subprocess or those that allow access to the filesystem as Cheetah templates are evaluated by `cobblerd` as code.

- default:

  `random` `re` `time` `netaddr`

## 5.2.29. client_use_https[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#client-use-https)

If set to `True`, all commands to the API (not directly to the XML-RPC server) will go over HTTPS instead of plain text. Be sure to change the `http_port` setting to the correct value for the web server.

default: `False`

## 5.2.30. client_use_localhost[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#client-use-localhost)

If set to `True`, all commands will be forced to use the localhost address instead of using the above value which can force commands like `cobbler sync` to open a connection to a remote address if one is in the configuration and would traceback.

default: `False`

## 5.2.31. cobbler_master[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#cobbler-master)

Used for replicating the Cobbler instance.

default: `""`

## 5.2.32. convert_server_to_ip[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#convert-server-to-ip)

Convert hostnames to IP addresses (where possible) so DNS isn’t a requirement for various tasks to work correctly.

default: `False`

## 5.2.33. createrepo_flags[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#createrepo-flags)

Default `createrepo_flags` to use for new repositories.

default: `"--cachedir=cache --update"`

## 5.2.34. default_name_*[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-name)

Configure all installed systems to use these name servers by default unless defined differently in the profile. For DHCP configurations you probably do **not** want to supply this.

defaults:

```
default_name_servers: []
default_name_servers_search: []
```

## 5.2.35. default_ownership[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-ownership)

if using the `authz_ownership` module, objects created without specifying an owner are assigned to this owner and/or group.

- default:

  `admin`

## 5.2.36. default_password_crypted[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-password-crypted)

Cobbler has various sample automatic installation templates stored in `/var/lib/cobbler/templates/`. This controls what install (root) password is set up for those systems that reference this variable. The factory default is “cobbler” and Cobbler check will warn if this is not changed. The simplest way to change the password is to run `openssl passwd -1` and put the output between the `""`.

default: `"$1$mF86/UHC$WvcIcX2t6crBz2onWxyac."`

## 5.2.37. default_template_type[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-template-type)

The default template type to use in the absence of any other detected template. If you do not specify the template with `#template=<template_type>` on the first line of your templates/snippets, Cobbler will assume try to use the following template engine to parse the templates.

Note

Over time we will try to deprecate and remove Cheetah3 as a template engine. It is hard to package and there are fewer guides then with Jinja2. Making the templating independent of the engine is a task which complicates the code. Thus, please try to use Jinja2. We will try to support a seamless transition on a best-effort basis.

Current valid values are: `cheetah`, `jinja2`

default: `"cheetah"`

## 5.2.38. default_virt_bridge[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-virt-bridge)

For libvirt based installs in Koan, if no virt-bridge is specified, which bridge do we try? For EL 4/5 hosts this should be `xenbr0`, for all versions of Fedora, try `virbr0`. This can be overridden on a per-profile basis or at the Koan command line though this saves typing to just set it here to the most common option.

default: `xenbr0`

## 5.2.39. default_virt_disk_driver[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-virt-disk-driver)

The on-disk format for the virtualization disk.

default: `raw`

## 5.2.40. default_virt_file_size[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-virt-file-size)

Use this as the default disk size for virt guests (GB).

default: `5.0`

## 5.2.41. default_virt_ram[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-virt-ram)

Use this as the default memory size for virt guests (MB).

default: `512`

## 5.2.42. default_virt_type[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#default-virt-type)

If Koan is invoked without `--virt-type` and no virt-type is set on the profile/system, what virtualization type should be assumed?

Current valid values are:

- `xenpv`
- `xenfv`
- `qemu`
- `vmware`

**NOTE**: this does not change what `virt_type` is chosen by import.

default: `xenpv`

## 5.2.43. enable_ipxe[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#enable-ipxe)

Enable iPXE booting? Enabling this option will cause Cobbler to copy the `undionly.kpxe` file to the TFTP root directory, and if a profile/system is configured to boot via iPXE it will chain load off `pxelinux.0`.

default: `False`

## 5.2.44. enable_menu[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#enable-menu)

Controls whether Cobbler will add each new profile entry to the default PXE boot menu. This can be over-ridden on a per-profile basis when adding/editing profiles with `--enable-menu=False/True`. Users should ordinarily leave this setting enabled unless they are concerned with accidental reinstall from users who select an entry at the PXE boot menu. Adding a password to the boot menus templates may also be a good solution to prevent unwanted reinstallations.

default: `True`

## 5.2.45. http_port[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#http-port)

Change this port if Apache is not running plain text on port 80. Most people can leave this alone.

default: `80`

## 5.2.46. iso_template_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#iso-template-dir)

Folder to search for the ISO templates. These will build the boot-menu of the built ISO.

default: `/etc/cobbler/iso`

## 5.2.47. jinja2_includedir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#jinja2-includedir)

This is a directory of files that Cobbler uses to include files into Jinja2 templates. Per default this settings is commented out.

default: `/var/lib/cobbler/jinja2`

## 5.2.48. kernel_options[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#kernel-options)

Kernel options that should be present in every Cobbler installation. Kernel options can also be applied at the distro/profile/system level.

default: `{}`

## 5.2.49. ldap_*[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#ldap)

Configuration options if using the authn_ldap module. See the Wiki for details. This can be ignored if you are not using LDAP for WebUI/XML-RPC authentication.

defaults:

```
ldap_server: "ldap.example.com"
ldap_base_dn: "DC=example,DC=com"
ldap_port: 389
ldap_tls: true
ldap_anonymous_bind: true
ldap_search_bind_dn: ''

ldap_tls_cacertfile: ''
ldap_tls_certfile: ''
ldap_tls_keyfile: ''
ldap_tls_reqcert: 'hard'
ldap_tls_cipher_suite: ''
```

## 5.2.50. bind_manage_ipmi[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#bind-manage-ipmi)

When using the Bind9 DNS server, you can enable or disable if the BMCs should receive own DNS entries.

default: `False`

## 5.2.51. manage_dhcp[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#manage-dhcp)

Set to `True` to enable Cobbler’s DHCP management features. The choice of DHCP management engine is under `modules.dhcp.module`.

default: `True`

## 5.2.52. manage_dhcp_v4[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#manage-dhcp-v4)

Set to `true` to enable DHCP IPv6 address configuration generation. This currently only works with manager.isc DHCP module (isc dhcpd6 daemon). See `modules.dhcp.module` whether this isc module is chosen for dhcp generation.

default: `False`

## 5.2.53. manage_dhcp_v6[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#manage-dhcp-v6)

Set to `true` to enable DHCP IPv6 address configuration generation. This currently only works with manager.isc DHCP module (isc dhcpd6 daemon). See `modules.dhcp.module` whether this isc module is chosen for dhcp generation.

default: `False`

## 5.2.54. manage_dns[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#manage-dns)

Set to `True` to enable Cobbler’s DNS management features. The choice of DNS management engine is under the key `modules.dns.module`.

default: `False`

## 5.2.55. manage_*_zones[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#manage-zones)

If using BIND (named) for DNS management in `modules.dns.module` and `manage_dns` is enabled (above), this lists which zones are managed. See [DNS configuration management](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/boot-cd.html#dns-management) for more information.

defaults:

```
manage_forward_zones: []
manage_reverse_zones: []
```

## 5.2.56. manage_genders[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#manage-genders)

Whether or not to manage the genders file. For more information on that visit: [github.com/chaos/genders](https://github.com/chaos/genders)

Cobbler only evaluates this if the key has a list of strings as  value. An empty list means you don’t have any proxies configured in your Uyuni setup.

default: `[]`

## 5.2.68. proxy_url_ext[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#proxy-url-ext)

External proxy which is used by the following commands: `reposync`, `signature update`

defaults:

```
http: http://192.168.1.1:8080
https: https://192.168.1.1:8443
```

## 5.2.69. proxy_url_int[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#proxy-url-int)

## 5.2.70. puppet_auto_setup[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#puppet-auto-setup)

If enabled, this setting ensures that puppet is installed during machine provision, a client certificate is generated and a certificate signing request is made with the puppet master server.

default: `False`

## 5.2.71. puppet_parameterized_classes[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#puppet-parameterized-classes)

Choose whether to enable puppet parameterized classes or not. Puppet versions prior to 2.6.5 do not support parameters.

## 5.2.72. puppet_server[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#puppet-server)

Choose a `--server` argument when running puppetd/puppet agent during autoinstall.

default: `'puppet'`

## 5.2.73. puppet_version[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#puppet-version)

Let Cobbler know that you’re using a newer version of puppet. Choose version 3 to use: ‘puppet agent’; version 2 uses status quo: ‘puppetd’.

default: `2`

## 5.2.74. puppetca_path[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#puppetca-path)

Location of the puppet executable, used for revoking certificates.

default: `"/usr/bin/puppet"`

## 5.2.75. pxe_just_once[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#pxe-just-once)

If this setting is set to `True`, Cobbler systems that pxe boot will request at the end of their installation to toggle the `--netboot-enabled` record in the Cobbler system record. This eliminates the potential for a PXE boot loop if the system is set to PXE first in it’s BIOS order. Enable this if PXE is first in your BIOS boot order, otherwise leave this disabled. See the manpage for `--netboot-enabled`.

default: `True`

## 5.2.76. nopxe_with_triggers[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#nopxe-with-triggers)

If this setting is set to `True`, triggers will be executed when systems will request to toggle the `--netboot-enabled` record at the end of their installation.

default: `True`

## 5.2.77. redhat_management_permissive[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#redhat-management-permissive)

If using `modules.authentication.module: "authentication.spacewalk"` in the settings to let Cobbler authenticate against Satellite/Spacewalk’s auth system, by default it will not allow per user access into Cobbler Web and Cobbler XML-RPC. In order to permit this, the following setting must be enabled HOWEVER doing so will permit all Spacewalk/Satellite users of certain types to edit all of Cobbler’s configuration. these roles are: `config_admin` and `org_admin`. Users should turn this on only if they want this behavior and do not have a cross-multi-org separation concern. If you have a single org in your satellite, it’s probably safe to turn this on and then you can use CobblerWeb alongside a Satellite install.

default: `False`

## 5.2.78. redhat_management_server[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#redhat-management-server)

This setting is only used by the code that supports using Uyuni/SUSE  Manager/Spacewalk/Satellite authentication within Cobbler Web and Cobbler XML-RPC.

default: `"xmlrpc.rhn.redhat.com"`

## 5.2.79. redhat_management_key[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#redhat-management-key)

Specify the default Red Hat authorization key to use to register system. If left blank, no registration will be attempted. Similarly you can set the `--redhat-management-key` to blank on any system to keep it from trying to register.

default: `""`

## 5.2.80. register_new_installs[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#register-new-installs)

If set to `True`, allows `/usr/bin/cobbler-register` (part of the Koan package) to be used to remotely add new Cobbler system records to Cobbler. This effectively allows for registration of new hardware from system records.

default: `False`

## 5.2.81. remove_old_puppet_certs_automatically[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#remove-old-puppet-certs-automatically)

When a puppet managed machine is reinstalled it is necessary to remove the puppet certificate from the puppet master server before a new certificate is signed (see above). Enabling the following feature will ensure that the certificate for the machine to be installed is removed from the puppet master server if the puppet master server is running on the same machine as Cobbler. This requires `puppet_auto_setup` above to be enabled

default: `False`

## 5.2.82. replicate_repo_rsync_options[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#replicate-repo-rsync-options)

Replication rsync options for repos set to override default value of `-avzH`.

default: `"-avzH"`

## 5.2.83. replicate_rsync_options[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#replicate-rsync-options)

replication rsync options for distros, autoinstalls, snippets set to override default value of `-avzH`.

default: `"-avzH"`

## 5.2.84. reposync_flags[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#reposync-flags)

Flags to use for yum’s reposync. If your version of yum reposync does not support some options, you may need to remove that options.

default: `"--newest-only --delete --refresh --remote-time"`

## 5.2.85. reposync_rsync_flags[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#reposync-rsync-flags)

Flags to use for rysync’s reposync. If archive mode (-a,–archive) is used then createrepo is not ran after the rsync as it pulls down the repodata as well. This allows older OS’s to mirror modular repos using rsync.

default: `"-rltDv --copy-unsafe-links"`

## 5.2.86. restart_*[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#restart)

When DHCP and DNS management are enabled, `cobbler sync` can automatically restart those services to apply changes. The exception for this is if using ISC for DHCP, then OMAPI eliminates the need for a restart. `omapi`, however, is experimental and not recommended for most configurations. If DHCP and DNS are going to be managed, but hosted on a box that is not on this server, disable restarts here and write some other script to ensure that the config files get copied/rsynced to the destination box. This can be done by modifying the restart services trigger. Note that if `manage_dhcp` and `manage_dns` are disabled, the respective parameter will have no effect. Most users should not need to change this.

defaults:

```
restart_dns: true
restart_dhcp: true
```

## 5.2.87. run_install_triggers[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#run-install-triggers)

Install triggers are scripts in `/var/lib/cobbler/triggers/install` that are triggered in autoinstall pre and post sections. Any executable script in those directories is run. They can be used to send email or perform other actions. They are currently run as root so if you do not need this functionality you can disable it, though this will also disable `cobbler status` which uses a logging trigger to audit install progress.

default: `true`

## 5.2.88. scm_track_*[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#scm-track)

enables a trigger which version controls all changes to `/var/lib/cobbler` when add, edit, or sync events are performed. This can be used to revert to previous database versions, generate RSS feeds, or for other auditing or backup purposes. Git and Mercurial are currently supported, but Git is the recommend SCM for use with this feature.

default:

```
scm_track_enabled: false
scm_track_mode: "git"
scm_track_author: "cobbler <cobbler@localhost>"
scm_push_script: "/bin/true"
```

## 5.2.89. serializer_pretty_json[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#serializer-pretty-json)

default: `False`

## 5.2.90. server[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#server)

This is the address of the Cobbler server – as it is used by systems during the install process, it must be the address or hostname of the system as those systems can see the server. if you have a server that appears differently to different subnets (dual homed, etc), you need to read the `--server-override` section of the manpage for how that works.

default: `127.0.0.1`

## 5.2.91. sign_puppet_certs_automatically[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#sign-puppet-certs-automatically)

When puppet starts on a system after installation it needs to have its certificate signed by the puppet master server. Enabling the following feature will ensure that the puppet server signs the certificate after installation if the puppet master server is running on the same machine as Cobbler. This requires `puppet_auto_setup` above to be enabled.

default: `false`

## 5.2.92. signature_path[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#signature-path)

The `cobbler import` workflow is powered by this file. Its location can be set with this config option.

default: `/var/lib/cobbler/distro_signatures.json`

## 5.2.93. signature_url[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#signature-url)

Updates to the signatures may happen more often then we have releases. To enable you to import new version we provide the most up to date signatures we offer on this like. You may host this file for yourself and adjust it for your needs.

default: `https://cobbler.github.io/signatures/3.0.x/latest.json`

## 5.2.94. tftpboot_location[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#tftpboot-location)

This variable contains the location of the tftpboot directory. If this directory is not present Cobbler does not start.

Default: `/srv/tftpboot`

## 5.2.95. virt_auto_boot[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#virt-auto-boot)

Should new profiles for virtual machines default to auto booting with the physical host when the physical host reboots? This can be overridden on each profile or system object.

default: `true`

## 5.2.96. webdir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#webdir)

Cobbler’s web directory.  Don’t change this setting – see the Wiki on “relocating your Cobbler install” if your /var partition is not large enough.

default: `@@webroot@@/cobbler`

## 5.2.97. webdir_whitelist[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#webdir-whitelist)

Directories that will not get wiped and recreated on a `cobbler sync`.

default:

```
webdir_whitelist:
  - misc
  - web
  - webui
  - localmirror
  - repo_mirror
  - distro_mirror
  - images
  - links
  - pub
  - repo_profile
  - repo_system
  - svc
  - rendered
  - .link_cache
```

## 5.2.98. windows_enabled[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#windows-enabled)

Set to true to enable the generation of Windows boot files in Cobbler.

default: `False`

For more information see [Windows installation with Cobbler](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/wingen.html#wingen).

## 5.2.99. windows_template_dir[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#windows-template-dir)

Location of templates used for Windows.

default: `/etc/cobbler/windows`

Samba share name for distros

default: `DISTRO`

For more information see [Windows installation with Cobbler](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/wingen.html#wingen).

## 5.2.101. xmlrpc_port[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#xmlrpc-port)

Cobbler’s public XML-RPC listens on this port. Change this only if absolutely needed, as you’ll have to start supplying a new port option to Koan if it is not the default.

default: `25151`

## 5.2.102. yum_distro_priority[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#yum-distro-priority)

The default yum priority for all the distros. This is only used if yum-priorities plugin is used. 1 is the maximum value. Tweak with caution.

default: `true`

## 5.2.103. yum_post_install_mirror[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#yum-post-install-mirror)

`cobbler repo add` commands set Cobbler up with repository information that can be used during autoinstall and is automatically set up in the Cobbler autoinstall templates. By default, these are only available at install time. To make these repositories usable on installed systems (since Cobbler makes a very convenient mirror) set this to `True`. Most users can safely set this to `True`. Users who have a dual homed Cobbler server, or are installing laptops that will not always have access to the Cobbler server may wish to leave this as `False`. In that case, the Cobbler mirrored yum repos are still accessible at `http://cobbler.example.org/cblr/repo_mirror` and YUM configuration can still be done manually. This is just a shortcut.

default: `True`

## 5.2.104. yumdownloader_flags[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#yumdownloader-flags)

Flags to use for yumdownloader. Not all versions may support `--resolve`.

default: `"--resolve"`

## 5.2.105. modules[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#modules)

If you have own custom modules which are not shipped with Cobbler directly you may have additional sections here.

### 5.2.105.1. authentication[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#authentication)

#### 5.2.105.1.1. module[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#module)

This settings decides the login mechanism is being used to log users

Choices:

- authentication.denyall    – No one
- authentication.configfile – Use /etc/cobbler/users.digest (default)
- authentication.passthru   – Ask Apache to handle it (used for kerberos)
- authentication.ldap       – Authenticate against LDAP
- authentication.spacewalk  – Ask Spacewalk/Satellite (experimental)
- authentication.pam        – Use PAM facilities
- (user supplied)  – You may write your own module

Note

A new web interface is in the making. At the moment we do not have any documentation, yet.

default: `authentication.configfile`

#### 5.2.105.1.2. hash_algorithm[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#hash-algorithm)

This parameter has currently only a meaning when the option `authentication.configfile` is used. The parameter decides what hashfunction algorithm is used for checking the passwords.

Choices:

- blake2b
- blake2s
- sha3_512
- sha3_384
- sha3_256
- sha3_224
- shake_128
- shake_256

default: `sha3_512`

### 5.2.105.2. authorization[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#authorization)

- authorization.ownership  – use users.conf, but add object ownership semantics
- (user supplied)  – you may write your own module

Warning

If you want to further restrict Cobbler with ACLs for various groups, pick `authorization.ownership`. `authorization.allowall` does not support ACLs. Configuration file does but does not support object ownership which is useful as an additional layer of control.

Note

A new web interface is in the making. At the moment we do not have any documentation, yet.

default: `authorization.allowall`

### 5.2.105.3. dns[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#dns)

#### 5.2.105.3.1. module[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#id2)

Choices:

- managers.bind    – default, uses BIND/named
- managers.dnsmasq – uses dnsmasq, also must select dnsmasq for DHCP below
- managers.ndjbdns – uses ndjbdns

Note

More configuration is still required in `/etc/cobbler`

For more information see [DNS configuration management](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/boot-cd.html#dns-management).

default: `managers.bind`

### 5.2.105.4. dhcp[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#dhcp)

#### 5.2.105.4.1. module[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#id3)

Chooses the DHCP management engine if `manage_dhcp` is enabled in the settings, which is off by default.

- managers.dnsmasq – uses dnsmasq, also must select dnsmasq for DNS above

Note

More configuration is still required in `/etc/cobbler`

For more information see [DHCP Management](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/boot-cd.html#dhcp-management).

default: `managers.isc`

### 5.2.105.5. tftpd[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#tftpd)

#### 5.2.105.5.1. module[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#id4)

Choices:

- serializers.file
- serializers.mongodb

default: `serializers.file`

### 5.2.105.7. mongodb[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#mongodb)

#### 5.2.105.7.1. host[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#host)

The host where MongoDB is running.

default: `localhost`

#### 5.2.105.7.2. port[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#port)

The port where MongoDB is running.

default: `False`

## 5.2.107. lazy_start[](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cobbler-conf/settings-yaml.html#lazy-start)

Set to `True` to speed up the start of the Cobbler. When storing collections as files, the directory with the names of the collection elements will be scanned without reading and parsing the files themselves. In the case of storing collections in the database, a projection query is made that includes only the names of the collection elements. The first time an attribute of an element other than a name is accessed, a full read of all other attributes will be performed, and a recursive full read of all elements on which this element depends. At startup, a background task is also launched, which, when idle, fills in all the properties of the elements of the collections. Suitable for configurations with a large number of elements placed on a slow device (HDD, network).

default: `False`
