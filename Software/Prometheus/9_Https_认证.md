# HTTPS and authentication

Prometheus supports basic authentication and TLS. This is **experimental** and might change in the future.

To specify which web configuration file to load, use the `--web.config.file` flag.

The file is written in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), defined by the scheme described below. Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the value is set to the specified default.

The file is read upon every http request, such as any change in the configuration and the certificates is picked up immediately.

Generic placeholders are defined as follows:

- `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
- `<filename>`: a valid path in the current working directory
- `<secret>`: a regular string that is a secret, such as a password
- `<string>`: a regular string

A valid example file can be found [here](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/release-2.46/documentation/examples/web-config.yml).

Prometheus支持基本的身份验证和TLS。这是实验性的，将来可能会改变。

若要指定要加载的Web配置文件，请使用--web.config.file标志。

该文件以YAML格式编写，由下面描述的方案定义。括号表示参数是可选的。对于非列表参数，该值设置为指定的默认值。

在每个http请求时读取该文件，例如配置中的任何更改，并立即获取证书。

通用占位符定义如下：

    <boolean>：一个布尔值，可以取值true或false
    <filename>：当前工作目录中的有效路径
    <secret>：一个常规的字符串，它是一个秘密，如密码
    <string>：常规字符串

可以在此处找到有效的示例文件。
