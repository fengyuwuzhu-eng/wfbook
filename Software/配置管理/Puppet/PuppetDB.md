# PuppetDB

All of the data generated by Puppet (for example facts, catalogs,        reports) is stored in PuppetDB.

Storing data in PuppetDB allows                Puppet to work faster and            provides an API for other applications to access Puppet's collected data. Once                PuppetDB is full of your            data, it becomes a great tool for infrastructure discovery, compliance reporting,            vulnerability assessment, and more. You perform all of these tasks with PuppetDB queries.

See the [PuppetDB docs](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/index.html) for more information.
