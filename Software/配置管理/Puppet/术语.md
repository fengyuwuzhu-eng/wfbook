## abstract data type

A classification for a type of data. See [type (data)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_data).

## agent

1. The agent software package. Puppet is usually deployed in a client-server                arrangement. When you install Puppet on a device, you’re installing the agent                software and its associated tools and dependencies. On *nix systems, this package is                called `puppet-agent`. 
2. The `puppet agent` daemon. You can invoke the agent software by                running the `puppet agent` command, or you can let it run in the                background as a daemon. 
3. A *node* that is running the agent software. By association, a *node*                running the agent daemon can be referred to as an agent node, or an agent. All                nodes, including server nodes, in a Puppet infrastructure run the agent to manage                their configuration.

An agent regularly performs *Puppet runs*, wherein it sends *facts* to a            *primary server* and receives a configuration *catalog*. The agent then        applies the catalog to the node by using its *providers*. 

## agentless

In the Puppet infrastructure, agentless is the term applied to a node or            device that operates without requiring an installed Puppet agent.

For example, agentless nodes do not have a running agent service. However,            you can use the Secure Socket Shell (SSH) network protocol or a Windows Remote            Management (WinRM) connection to add agentless nodes to the Puppet Enterprise            inventory.

Agentless devices such as network switches or firewalls cannot have a Puppet            agent installed. However, you can connect the devices to the Puppet infrastructure to            manage the devices and run tasks. See [agent](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#agent).

## attribute

Attributes specify the desired state of a given configuration            resource. Each resource type has a different set of attributes, and each        attribute has its own set of allowed values. For example, a package resource        (like `vim`) would have an `ensure` attribute, whose value        could be `present`, `latest`, `absent`, or a        version number:

```
package {'vim':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => apt,
}Copied!
```

You specify an attribute’s value with the `=>` operator, and        pairs of attributes and values are separated by commas.

For definitions of terms, see                [resource](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#resource) and [value](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#value). For detailed information, see                [Resource Type Reference](https://docs-herrera-preview.netlify.app/docs/puppet/latest/type.html).

## catalog

A catalog is a file that describes the desired state of each managed            resource on a node. It is a compilation of all the resources            that the Puppet agent applies to a given node, as well as the            relationships between those resources. 

Catalogs are compiled by a primary server from manifests and            agent-provided data (such as facts, certificates, and an                environment if one is provided), as well as optional external data            (such as data from an external node classifier, exported                resources, and functions). The primary server then serves the            compiled catalog to the agent when requested. 

Unlike the manifests from which they were compiled, catalogs don't contain conditional            logic or functions. Catalogs are unambiguous and relevant only to a            specific node. 

See [manifest](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#manifest) and [compile](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#compile). For detailed information, see                [Catalog compilation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/subsystem_catalog_compilation.html#subsystem_catalog_compilation). 

## class

A class is a collection of related resources that, after the            class is defined, can be declared as a single unit. For            example, a class can contain all of the resources (such as files, settings,                modules, and scripts) needed to configure the Apache web server on a            host. Classes can also declare other classes. For more information, see the [Classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_classes.html#lang_classes) page in the Puppet language            reference. 

 Classes are singletons and can be applied only once in a given            configuration; although the `include` function allows you to declare a            class multiple times, Puppet evaluates it only once. 

 The `require` and `contain` functions can create                relationships between classes. For more information, see [Containment](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_containment.html#lang_containment) in the Puppet language reference. 

Tip:  Being singletons, Puppet classes are not analogous to classes in                object-oriented programming languages. Object-oriented classes are like templates                that can be instantiated multiple times; Puppet's equivalent to this concept is                    defined types.

## classify

 (or node classification) 

 To assign classes to a node, as well as provide any data            required by the classes, you classify the node. 

 By writing a class, you enable a set of configurations. By classifying a node with the            class, you describe the node's desired configuration. 

 You can classify nodes through node definitions in the main                manifest, or with the Puppet Enterprise node manager or an external                node classifier. See [class](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#class).

## compile

A primary server creates a catalog by compiling            manifests and agent-provided data, as well as any provided external data. During        a Puppet run, an agent requests its node's compiled catalog, and        then the agent applies the catalog to configure the node. For detailed information, see            [Catalog compilation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/subsystem_catalog_compilation.html#subsystem_catalog_compilation). 

## compiler

1. A program that turns Puppet code into a Puppet catalog file. The                catalog file describes the desired state of each managed resource on a                    node. During a Puppet run, the agent uses the catalog to configure                each node.
2. An additional Puppet Server instance that is dedicated to catalog                compilation. You can add Puppet Server instances to offload catalog compilation from                the primary server. In this way, you can distribute the workload, compile catalogs                faster, and increase the number of agents that can be managed.

See [catalog](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#catalog).

## console

​        Puppet Enterprise includes a web user interface called the        console, which provides tools for managing your Puppet infrastructure. For        example, you can use it to classify nodes, manage Puppet services, trigger and        view reports and metrics about Puppet runs and activity, and        examine inventory data and resources. For detailed information, see the [Puppet Enterprise documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/pe_user_guide.html). 

## core data type

 (or concrete data type) 

See [type (data)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_data).

## corrective change

A corrective change is a remedial action taken by a Puppet                agent to address unauthorized or unintentional changes on a                node. The agent makes the corrective change to ensure that node            properties match the node catalog.

After an unauthorized or unintentional change occurs on a node, the next Puppet run            compares the node catalog with the state of each property on each managed                resource of the node. Puppet then corrects any inconsistencies. 

Restriction: Corrective change reporting is available only on agent nodes that            run Puppet Enterprise 2016.4 or later. Agents running earlier versions report all change            events as `With intentional changes`.

See [intentional change](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#intentional_change).

## data type

A classification for data. See [type (data)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_data).

## declare

To direct Puppet to include a given class or resource in a            given configuration, you declare the class or resource by using the                Puppet language. To declare classes, use a function (such            as `include`) or the `class {'my_class':}` syntax. To            declare resources, use the lowercase `file {'/tmp/my_file':}` syntax. 

 You can configure a resource or class when you declare it by including                attribute-value pairs. 

 For more information, see [Defining classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_classes.html#lang_classes) and                [Resources](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_resources.html#lang_resources). Contrast with [define](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#define). 

## define

1. *verb:* To specify the contents and behavior of a class or a                    defined type, you define the class or type by using                the Puppet language. Defining a class or type doesn't automatically                include it in a configuration; it simply makes it available to be                    declared. 
2. *noun:* An older term for a defined type. For instance, a module                might refer to its available defines. 
3. *keyword:* You use the `define`                Puppet language keyword to create a defined                type.

 For more information, see [Defined resource                 types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_defined_types.html). 

## defined type

 (or defined resource type) 

 See [type (defined)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_defined).

## design pattern

 A design pattern is a colloquial term used to describe a collection of        related manifests that are designed to solve an issue or manage a particular        configuration item. For example, an "Apache pattern" refers        to the manifests designed to configure Apache. See also [module](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#module). 

## environment

An environment is an isolated group of agent nodes that a                primary server can serve with its own main manifest and            set of modules. For example, you can use environments to set up scratch                nodes for testing before rolling out changes to production, or to            divide a site by types of hardware. 

For more information, see [About environments](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/environments_about.html#environments_about).

## exported resource

An exported resource is a resource that you've                declared to be available to other nodes that can then            collect the exported resource and manage their own copies. This lets you share a            resource's desired state across nodes, such as when one node depends on information on            another node for its configuration, or when you need to monitor a resource's state. 

For more information, see [Exported resources](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_exported.html).        

## expression

An expression is a statement that resolves to a value. The Puppet language supports several types of expressions for            comparison and evaluation purposes, including Boolean expressions, comparison            expressions, and arithmetic expressions. For more information, see [Expressions and operators](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_expressions.html#lang_expressions).

## external node classifier

An external node classifier (ENC) is an executable script that returns            information about which classes to apply to a node when called            by a primary server. For example, Puppet Enterprise            acts as an ENC.

ENCs provide an alternative to using a site's main manifest to classify            nodes. An ENC can be written in any programming language, and can use information from            any data source (for example, a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol database) when            classifying nodes. 

An ENC is called with the name of the node to be classified as an argument, and returns a            YAML document describing the node. For more information, see [Classifying nodes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/nodes_external.html#writing-node-classifiers).

## fact

A fact is a piece of information about a node, such as its            hostname, IP address, or operating system. 

Facter reads facts from a node and makes them available to Puppet. You can            extend Facter with custom facts, which can expose            site-specific details of your systems to your Puppet            manifests. See [Facter](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#facter). For more information, see [Writing custom facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/fact_overview.html#fact_overview).

## Facter

Facter is the Puppet system inventory tool.                Facter reads facts about a                node, such as its hostname, IP address, and operating system, and makes            them available to Puppet. 

Facter includes many built-in facts, and you can view their names and values            for a particular node by running the  `facter` command on the node's            command line. 

In agent-server Puppet arrangements, agents send their            nodes' facts to the primary server. 

For more information, see the [Facter             documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/facter.html).

## filebucket

A repository in which Puppet stores file backups when it            has to replace files is called a filebucket. 

A filebucket can be local (and owned by the node being managed) or            site-global (and owned by the primary server). Typically, a single            filebucket is defined for a network and is used as the default backup location. For more            information, see [filebucket](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/types/filebucket.html).

## function

A function is a Puppet language statement that returns a                value or modifies a catalog. Puppet has many built-in functions, and                modules can add their own functions. You can also write custom            functions. 

Functions generally take at least one value as an argument, execute Puppet code, and return a value. Because Puppet evaluates functions during                compilation, the primary server executes them in an agent-server            arrangement. Puppet functions can access only the                facts that an agent submitted. 

Contrast with [lambda](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#lambda). 

## Hiera

The Hiera tool, which ships with the agent, provides a            hierarchical key-value lookup for site-specific data. By using Hiera, you            can take site-specific data out of your manifests and place the data in a            centralized location, while also setting default data and overriding certain specified                values when necessary. For more information, see [Separating data (Hiera)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/hiera.html). 

## host

1. Any device, physical or virtual, attached to a network is a host. In                the Puppet documentation, a host can refer to a device running the                    agent daemon. See also [node](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#node).
2. A resource type: A host can refer to an entry in a system's                    `hosts` file, which is used for name resolution. Puppet includes                a type module to manage hosts. For more information, see the [Host core module](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/host_core/readme) on the Forge. 

## idempotent

Idempotence refers to the concept of doing something multiple times with the            same outcome. Puppet            resources are idempotent, because they describe a desired final state            rather than a series of steps to follow. 

The most prominent exception among Puppet resources is the                `exec` resource type, which is idempotent but relies on the user to            design the resource accordingly.

## inheritance

Inheritance is a process whereby a Puppet class can be derived from        another class by using the `inherits` keyword. The derived class            declares all of the same resources, but can override some of        their attributes and add new resources. Use inheritance very sparingly. For        more information, see [Classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_classes.html#lang_classes).

## intentional change

After you update the Puppet code, the Puppet agent makes an                intentional change to ensure that the properties of the                node reflect the latest changes in the node catalog. 

After a node catalog is updated, the next Puppet run compares the node catalog with the            state of each property on each managed resource of the node. Puppet then            corrects any inconsistencies in the node properties.

An intentional change can also be applied to a freshly provisioned node, which is taken            from an unconfigured state to match the expected desired state.

Contrast with [corrective change](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#corrective_change).

## JRuby

JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language that runs        within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Puppet Server runs within the JVM as        JRuby processes and listens for incoming requests from Puppet agents.

The JVM            allows Puppet Server to run multiple compilers in a pool, responding            concurrently to catalog requests as needed.

## lambda

(or code block) 

A lambda is a block of parameterized Puppet language code that            you can pass to certain functions. For more information, see [ Lambdas](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_lambdas.html). 

## local scope

An area of Puppet code. See [scope](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#scope).

## main manifest

(or site manifest) 

A manifest is a file containing Puppet code. In Puppet, the main manifest is            the point-of-entry manifest used by a primary server when                compiling a catalog. 

The main, or site, manifest file is usually named `site.pp`.            Its location is set with the `manifest` setting in the                `environment.conf` file, with a default location set by the                `default_manifest` setting in the `puppet.conf` file. 

For more information, see [Main manifest                 directory](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/dirs_manifest.html). 

## manifest

A manifest is a file containing Puppet code.            In Puppet, a manifest file contains code written in the                Puppet language. The file has a `.pp` file extension.            The Puppet code in a manifest can: 

- Declare                    resources and classes.
- Set variables.
- Evaluate functions.
- Define                    classes, defined types, functions, and                        nodes.

Most manifests are contained in modules. Every manifest in a module defines            a single class, defined type, or function. 

The primary server service reads an environment's main                manifest. This manifest usually defines nodes, so that each            managed agent receives a unique catalog. 

See also [main manifest](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#main_manifest). 

## manifest ordering

Manifest ordering is the process of applying unrelated resources in the        order in which they are declared in their manifests. These are "soft" ordering        relationships, meaning that they will be overridden by any ordering relationships specified        in code. For related resources, or for more information about manifest ordering, see [Relationships and ordering](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_relationships.html#lang_relationships). 

## metaparameter

A metaparameter is a resource attribute that can be        specified for any type of resource. Metaparameters are part of the Puppet framework rather than part of a specific            type, and usually affect the way resources relate to each other. For a list        of metaparameters and their usage, see [Metaparameter reference](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/metaparameter.html). 

## module

A module is a collection of classes, resource                types, files, functions, and templates, organized            around a particular purpose. For example, a module can configure an Apache web server instance or Rails application. Modules            can be downloaded from the Puppet            Forge. 

For more information, see [Modules                 overview](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/modules_fundamentals.html#modules_fundamentals) and [Installing and managing                 modules from the command line](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/modules_installing.html#modules_installing).

## namevar

(or name) 

The namevar attribute represents a resource's unique identity            on a target system. For example, two different files cannot have the same                `path`, and two different services cannot have the same                `name`. 

Every resource type has a designated namevar, usually `name`.            Some resource types, such as `file` or `exec`, use a            namevar other than name (in these cases, `path` and                `command`, respectively). If a type's namevar is something other than                `name`, the namevar is mentioned in the type reference documentation. 

Tip: If you don't specify a value for a resource's namevar when you                declare it, the namevar defaults to that resource's            title.

## node

A node is a device managed by Puppet. Some nodes are primary                servers, which compile manifests into catalogs;            most nodes, including most primary servers, are agents, which receive            catalogs and apply them to the node during a Puppet run. Most nodes are            computers (such as workstations and servers), but some aren't (such as supported network            switches and storage appliances). 

 A node is also one of the fundamental units of a puppetized infrastructure.            See also [classify](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#classify), [node definition](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#node_definition), and [scope](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#scope). 

## node definition

(or node statement) 

A node definition is a collection of classes,                resources, and variables in a manifest that            are applied only to a certain agent node. Node definitions begin with the                `node` keyword, and can include the node’s full name or regular            expression. 

When a node retrieves or compiles its catalog, the node            receives the contents of a single matching node statement as well as any classes or            resources declared outside any node statement. The classes in all other node statements            are hidden from that node. 

For more information, see [Node                 definitions](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_node_definitions.html).

## node management

Puppet Enterprise provides node management workflows        and tools to help you classify nodes using fact-based rules in the console. For more        information, see [Managing nodes](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/managing_nodes.html) in the Puppet Enterprise        documentation.

## node run status

When Puppet manages a node during a                Puppet run, Puppet attempts bring the            node into compliance with its catalog. The state of the node after a run,            as tracked by Puppet Enterprise, is called the node run                status. The following node run statuses are possible: 

- With failures
- With corrective changes 
- With intentional changes 
- Unchanged

When a no-op Puppet run determines that it would have            modified the node during a normal Puppet run, the node            run status indicates that the change would have been made (but wasn't). There are also            run statuses for unresponsive or not completely configured nodes.

For more information, see [no-op](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#noop) and [Monitoring infrastructure state](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/monitor_infrastructure_state.html).

## node scope



An area of Puppet code. See [scope](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#scope).



## no-op

(or noop) 

By running Puppet in no-op mode                (`noop` in code, short for "no operations" mode), you simulate what                Puppet would do during an actual run. No-op mode            allows you to perform a dry run that logs planned activity but doesn't affect                nodes. To run Puppet in no-op mode, run                `puppet agent` or `puppet apply` with the                `--noop` flag. 

## notification

A notification is a type of relationship that both declares        an order for resources and causes refresh events to be sent. A        notification relationship is set with the `notify` metaparameter or the wavy        chaining arrow `~>`. For more information, see [Relationships and ordering](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_relationships.html#lang_relationships).

## ordering

By ordering resources, you determine which resources are managed before            others. 

By default, Puppet uses manifest ordering,            which evaluates resources in the order they're declared in their manifests.                Puppet also obeys relationships you            provide that determine whether a resource depends on other resources. For more            information, see [Relationships and                 ordering](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_relationships.html#lang_relationships). 

## parameter

A parameter is a chunk of information that a class or                resource can accept. 

1. *In a custom type and provider development:* A parameter describes attributes                of a declared resource. When that resource is enforced on a node, Puppet uses the                logic encapsulated within the resource type and provider to ensure that the state of                the node matches the desired state expressed by the resource parameters. 

2. In defined types and parameterized classes:

    A parameter is a                    

   variable

    in the 

   definition

    of a 

   class

    or                    

   defined type

   , whose 

   value

    is set by a 

   resource                    attribute

    when an instance of that type or class is                

   declared

   . 

   ```
   define my_new_type ($my_parameter) {
     file { "$title":
       ensure  => file,
       content => $my_parameter,
     }
   }
   
   my_new_type { '/tmp/test_file':
     my_parameter => "This text will become the content of the file.",
   }Copied!
   ```

    The parameters you use when defining a type or class specify the attributes                    that are available when the type or class is declared.

3. *For external nodes:* A parameter is a top-scope variable set by                an external node classifier. Although these are called parameters, they                are variables; the name refers to how they are usually used to configure the                behavior of classes.

## plug-in

A plug-in is a custom type, function, or            fact that extends Puppet capabilities and is        distributed in a module. For more information, see [Plug-ins in modules](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/plugins_in_modules.html#plugins_in_modules).

## plusignment operator

The plusignment operator        `+>` adds values to resource attributes by using        the plusignment syntax. This operator is useful when you want to override resource        attributes without having to specify already declared values a second time. For more        information, see the section about appending to resource attributes in [Classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_classes.html#lang_classes).

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the backend data storage layer for PuppetDB. If            you install PuppetDB by using the Puppet module, the PostgreSQL server is            configured and no further action is required. If you do not install PuppetDB by using            the Puppet module, you must configure a PostgreSQL server to include a user and an empty            database for PuppetDB. See [PuppetDB](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#puppetdb).

## primary server

(or primary Puppet server) 

In a standard Puppet client-server deployment, the server            is known as the primary server. The primary server compiles            and serves configuration catalogs on demand to agents on            client nodes. 

The primary server provides catalogs to agents by using an HTTP server. The primary            server can run as a standalone daemon with a built-in web server, or, especially if            you're managing more than 10 nodes, as part of [Puppet Server](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#puppet_server).

For more information, see [architecture](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/architecture.html).

## profile

In the roles and profiles pattern of Puppet            code development, a profile represents the configuration of a technology            stack for a site, and typically consists of one or more                classes. A role can include as many profiles as required to define            itself. Profiles are included in role and profile modules. 

For more information, see [The roles and profiles method](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/the_roles_and_profiles_method.html#the_roles_and_profiles_method) in the Puppet Enterprise documentation. 

## property

In custom type and provider development, a property is a value            that corresponds to an observable part of the target node's state. When            retrieving a resource's state, a property calls the specified method on the                provider, which reads the state from the system. If the current state            does not match the specified state, the provider changes it. 

Properties appear as attributes when declaring instances of            this resource type. 

## provider

A provider implements a resource type on a specific type of            system by using the system's own tools. The division between types and providers allows            a single resource type (such as `package`) to manage packages on many            different systems by using, for example, `yum` on Red Hat systems and `dpkg` and                `apt` on Debian-based systems. 

Providers are often Ruby wrappers around shell            commands.

## Puppet

Puppet can refer to several things: 

- The Puppet suite of automation products.
- The open source Puppet project.
- The command you run to invoke the agent daemon on a                        node.
- The Puppet language that you use you write                    manifests.
- The Puppet business unit in Perforce Software,                    Inc.

## Puppet Enterprise

​        Puppet Enterprise (PE) is a software solution for automatically managing IT        infrastructures. As the flagship product in the Puppet family        of IT automation tools, PE can be used to manage thousands of nodes, which can        include computers, workstations, and other devices. To get started, you can use the            console, a web-based user interface, to group and classify nodes. The        desired state for each node is maintained in a catalog by the primary server.            Puppet        agents receive the catalog and verify the nodes against the        desired state. If an agent finds nodes that are not in compliance, the agent makes the        necessary corrections. In this way, PE helps to ensure that all nodes comply with the        organization’s requirements. See [Puppet Enterprise deployment](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#pe_deployment).

## Puppet Enterprise deployment

A Puppet Enterprise            deployment is the implementation of Puppet Enterprise            infrastructure components and agents on nodes in your            environment. A centralized deployment is used for management across all regions. In a            federated deployment, an independent Puppet cluster is            deployed per region. A deployment can be based on different architectures, including a            standard installation, a large installation, and an extra-large installation. See [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#puppet_enterprise).

## Puppet language

You write Puppet code in the Puppet            language. Puppet language files are called            manifests and are named with the `.pp` extension. The            primary server        compiles this Puppet code into a            catalog during a Puppet run. For more information, see [Puppet language overview](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/intro_puppet_language_and_code.html#intro_puppet_language_and_code) and the rest of the [Puppet language](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/puppet_language.html) documentation.

## Puppet run

A Puppet run is when an  agent sends facts and an            identifying certificate to the primary server, and requests a                compiled            catalog in return. The agent applies that catalog to the node            by using operating system-specific providers to bring the node's                properties in line with the catalog's definitions. The agent then sends            a report of logs and metrics to the primary server. 

By default, a Puppet run takes place every 30 minutes,            even if no changes have occurred in the agent's catalog or configuration. For a detailed            description of a Puppet run, see [Agent-primary server HTTPS                 communications](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/subsystem_agent_primary_comm.html#subsystem_agent_primary_comm).

## Puppet Server

Puppet Server is an open source Java Virtual Machine application that        provides scalable primary server services and an administrative API for        maintenance. For more information, see the [Puppet             Server documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/server/about_server.html).

## PuppetDB

PuppetDB is an open source database that caches and stores data that is        generated and used throughout the Puppet infrastructure.        PuppetDB provides an API for other applications to access Puppet's collected data. PuppetDB        also enables advanced Puppet features, such as exported            resources. For more information, see the [PuppetDB documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/puppetdb_overview.html) and [exported resource](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#exported_resource).

## Puppetfile

A Puppetfile is an authoritative, standalone list that tells Puppet Enterprise which modules to install, what versions        to install, and which source to use. By using a Puppetfile, you can manage the installation        of sets of modules. For more information, see [Managing environment content with a Puppetfile](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/puppetfile.html).

## puppetize

To puppetize your infrastructure is to bring it under automated        management by capturing the configuration in Puppet language form and using Puppet to reach and maintain the desired state. Puppetizing        your infrastructure is an iterative, incremental, and ongoing process of gradually bringing        more and more of your services, applications, nodes, and devices under Puppet management.

## r10k

The r10k tool in Puppet Enterprise is one of the options for        helping you manage and deploy Puppet code in            environments and modules by using Puppetfiles.        For more information, see [Managing and deploying Puppet code](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.6/managing_puppet_code.html).

## realize

To specify that a virtual resource is applied to the current system, it must            be realized. After you declare a virtual resource, there are            two methods for realizing it: 

- Use the spaceship syntax `<||>`                
- Use the `realize`                    function. 

A virtually declared resource is present in the catalog but won't be applied            to a system until it is realized. For more information, see [Virtual resources](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_virtual.html). 

## refresh

A resource is refreshed when a resource it                subscribes to (or which notifies it) is modified. 

Different resource types do different things when they're refreshed. For instance,            services restart, mount points unmount and remount, and the `exec`            resource type executes if the `refreshonly` attribute is set. 

## relationship

A rule that sets the order in which resources are managed creates a                relationship between those resources. For more information, see [Relationships and ordering](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_relationships.html#lang_relationships). 

## report

You can configure agents to send reports containing logs and            metrics at the end of every Puppet run. A report processor            transforms those reports into a different format and sends it to another application,            location, or service. 

 For more information, see [Puppet reports](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/reporting.html). 

## report processor

A report processor takes a Puppet            report, transforms it to a specific format, and sends it to another            application, location, or service. Puppet ships with            built-in report processors, and you can write your own. For more information, see [Puppet reports](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/reporting.html). 

## resource

A resource is a unit of configuration whose state can be managed by Puppet. Every resource has a type (such as                `file`, `service`, or `user`), a                title, and one or more attributes with specified                values. 

Resources can be large or small, and simple or complex. They do not always directly map            to simple details on the client — they might involve spreading information across            multiple files or modifying devices. For example, a `service` resource            models a single service, but might involve executing an `init` script,            running an external command to check its status, and modifying the system's run level            configuration. 

For more information, see [attribute](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#attribute), [value](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#value), [Resources](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_resources.html#lang_resources), and [Resource Type Reference](https://docs-herrera-preview.netlify.app/docs/puppet/latest/type.html).

## resource declaration

A resource declaration is a fragment of Puppet code that details the desired state of a resource and instructs Puppet to manage it. This term helps to differentiate            between the literal resource on a system and the specification for how to manage that            resource. However, resource declarations are often referred to simply as                resources. 

## role

In the roles and profiles pattern of Puppet            coding, a role defines the business purpose that a node            performs. A role typically consists of one class that can completely            configure categories of nodes with profiles. Classify a node with only one            role; if a node requires more than one existing role, create a new role for it. 

For more information, see [Designing system configs (roles and profiles)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/designing_system_configs_roles_and_profiles.html). 

## role and profile module

A role and profile module is a Puppet            module that assigns configuration data to groups of nodes            based on roles and profiles. A role and profile module doesn't            have special features, but it represents an abstract, private,                site-specific way to use modules to configure technology stacks and            node descriptions. 

For more information, see [Designing system configs (roles and profiles)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/designing_system_configs_roles_and_profiles.html). 

## scope

 (or variable scope; includes local scope, node        scope, and top scope) 

The scope refers to an area of Puppet code            that is partially isolated from other areas of code. Scopes limit the reach of                variables and resource defaults. Scopes can be named (such as scopes            created by class definitions) or anonymous (such as scopes created by                lambdas and defined resources). 

In general, if multiple variables with the same name are available, Puppet uses the variable from the most local scope.                
![A diagram of several scopes. Top scope contains node scope, which contains the example::other, example::four, and example::parent scopes. Example::parent contains the example::child scope.](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/scope-euler-diagram.png)
        

 The three most common scopes you'll work with in the Puppet language are: 

- ​                    Top scope, from which variables are accessible from anywhere by                    their short name (such as `$my_variable`) but can be overridden                    in a local scope. The top scope's name is always an empty string, and top-scope                    variables can always be accessed using the double-colon namespace separator with                    an empty string (`$::my_variable`). 
- ​                    Node scope, a special scope created in a node                        definition. You can refer to a node-scope variable from anywhere                    within a node scope by its short name, and node-scope variables can override                    top-scope variables. 
- ​                    Local scope, where you can refer to a variable by its short name                    inside that scope and the scope's children, but typically cannot access it from                    other scopes. 

There are a few exceptions, and you might also encounter other,            more situational scopes. For detailed information, see [Scope](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_scope.html#lang_scope). 

Note: Previously, Puppet used dynamic scope, which would                search for short-named variables through a long chain of parent scopes. Dynamic                scope was deprecated in Puppet 2.7, and is now used                only for resource defaults.

## serverless

Serverless refers to a Puppet        node that does not rely on a primary server to supply its            catalog. See [agent](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#agent).

## singleton

A singleton is an object in the Puppet language, such as a                class, that can be evaluated only one time. For example, you can't have            more than one distinct class with the same specific name in a                manifest or catalog, making that class a singleton. 

## site

A site refers to an entire IT ecosystem that is managed by Puppet. A site includes all your organization's                primary server servers, agent nodes, serverless            Puppet-managed nodes, and nodes or devices with agentless connections to                Bolt or PE management.        

## site module

A site module is a module that contains classes            specific to a given Puppet            site. These classes describe complete configurations for a specific system            or group of systems. For example, the `site::db_replica` class would            describe the entire configuration of a database server, and a new database server could            be configured by applying that class to it. 

## subclass

A subclass is a class that inherits from another class. See                [inheritance](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#inheritance). 

## subscribe

A subscription is a notification relationship set with the                `subscribe`            metaparameter or the wavy chaining arrow `~>`. For more            information, see [Relationships and                 ordering](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_relationships.html#lang_relationships). 

## template

A template is a partial document that is filled in with data from                variables. Puppet can use Embedded Puppet (EPP) templates written in the Puppet                language, or Embedded Ruby (ERB) templates            written in Ruby, to generate configuration files tailored            to an individual system. For more information, see [Templates](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_template.html).        

## title

A title is the unique identifier of a resource or                class in a given Puppet            catalog. 

- In a class, the title is the class name. 

- In a resource 

  declaration

  , the title is the part after the first curly                brace and before the colon. In the example below, the title is                    

  ```
  /etc/passwd
  ```

  :                

  ```
  file  { '/etc/passwd':
    owner => 'root',
    group => 'root',
  }Copied!
  ```

- In native resource types, the name or namevar uses the title as its                    default value if you don't explicitly specify a name.             

- In a defined type or a class, the title is available for use                    throughout the definition as the `$title`                    variable.             

Unlike the name or namevar, a resource title need not map to any attribute            of the target system; it is only a referent. You can give a resource a single title even            if its name must vary across different kinds of systems. 

For more information on resource titles, see [Resources](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_resources.html#lang_resources).

## top scope

See [scope](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#scope). 

## type

A type is a kind of resource that Puppet is able to manage. For example,                `file`, `cron`, and `service` are all            resource types. A type specifies the set of attributes that a resource of that type can            use, and models the behavior of that kind of resource on the target system. You can            declare many resources of a given type. 

Puppet ships with a set of built-in resource                types. See the [Resource types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/resource_types.html) documentation for a            complete list. New native types can be added as plugins, and                defined types can be constructed by grouping together resources of            existing types. 

Contrast with [type (data)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_data). See also [type (defined)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_defined) and                [type (native)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_native). 

## type (data)

 (or data type; includes abstract data type and core data                type) 

 Every value has a data type, which is a named classification            of a type of data that a variable or parameter can hold. The                Puppet language has core data types (such as integer, Boolean, or            string) and abstract data types (such as any or optional). For more information, see                [Values and data types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_data.html). 

## type (defined)

(or defined type, or defined resource type; sometimes called a                define or definition) 

A defined type is a resource type that is defined            as a group of other resources, written in the Puppet language,            and saved in a manifest. For example, a defined type could use a            combination of `file` and `exec` resources to configure            and populate a Git repository. 

After you define a type, new resources of that type can be declared just            like any native or custom resource; these are called defined resources. 

Because defined types are written in the Puppet language            instead of as Ruby plug-ins, they are analogous to macros            in other languages. Contrast with  [type (native)](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#type_native). 

For more information, see [Defined resource                 types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_defined_types.html). 

## type (native)

(or native type, or native resource type) 

A native type is a resource type that is written in Ruby. Puppet ships with a            set of built-in native types, and custom native types can be distributed as                plugins in modules. For a complete list of built-in types,            see [Resource types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/resource_types.html). 

Native types have lower-level access to the target system than defined            types, and can use the system's own tools to make changes. Most native types have            one or more providers that can implement the same resources on different            kinds of systems. 

## value

In the Puppet language, a value is a piece of data that has a            certain data type, or in some cases represents a literal data type. You can            assign values to variables and parameters. For more information, see [Values, data types, and aliases](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_data.html). 

## variable

In a Puppet manifest, a variable is a named            placeholder that represents a value. After a variable is assigned a value,            the variable cannot be assigned a different value within the same scope;            however, other scopes can assign different values to that variable name. 

Variables in Puppet are indicated with a dollar sign                (`$operatingsystem`, also known as a short name) and assigned with            the equal sign (`$operatingsystem = "Debian"`). In certain scopes,            variables can also be accessed using a qualified name consisting of the scope name,            followed by a double-colon namespace separator, then the variable name; this pattern can            be repeated to drill down through multiple scopes. For example,                `$apache::params::confdir` represents the `confdir`            variable in the `params` subclass of the `apache` class. 

Facts from nodes are represented as variables within Puppet            manifests, and are automatically assigned before compilation begins. There            are also several other pre-assigned variables. For more information, see [Facts and built-in variables](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html). 

## variable scoping

See [scope](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/glossary.html#scope). 

## virtual resource

A virtual resource is a resource that is declared in the                catalog but isn't applied to a system unless the virtual resource is            explicitly realized. 

For more information, see [Virtual resources](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/lang_virtual.html).
