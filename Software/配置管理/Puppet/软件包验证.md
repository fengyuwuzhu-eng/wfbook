[TOC]

Puppet signs most of its      packages, Ruby gems, and release tarballs with GNU Privacy      Guard (GPG). This signature proves that the packages originate from Puppet and have not been compromised. Security-conscious users      can use GPG to verify package signatures.

Tip:

Certain operating systems and               installation methods automatically verify package signatures. In these cases, you               don’t need to do anything to verify the package signature. 

- If you install from the Puppet Yum and Apt repositories, the release                        package that enables the repository also installs our release signing key.                        The Yum and Apt tools automatically verify the integrity of packages as you                        install them. 
- If you install a Windows                        agent using an .msi package, the Windows                        installer automatically verifies the signature before installing the                        package.          

## Verify a source tarball or gem

You can manually verify the signature for Puppet source tarballs or Ruby      gems.

1. Import the public key: `gpg --keyserver                    hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371 --recv-key 4528B6CD9E61EF26`                

   Tip:  If this is your first time running the gpg tool, it might                            fail to import the key after creating its configuration file and                            keyring. You can run the command a second time to import the key into                            your newly created keyring.

   The gpg tool imports the                        key:

   ```
   gpg: /home/username/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
   gpg: key 4528B6CD9E61EF26: public key "Puppet, Inc. Release Key (Puppet, Inc. Release Key) <release@puppet.com>" imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1Copied!
   ```

2. Verify the fingerprint: `gpg --list-key --fingerprint                        4528B6CD9E61EF26`

   The fingerprint of the Puppet release signing                        key is `D681 1ED3 ADEE B844 1AF5 AA8F 4528 B6CD 9E61 EF26`. Ensure the                        fingerprint listed matches this value. 

3. ​            Download the tarball or gem and its corresponding `.asc` file from [https://downloads.puppet.com/puppet/](https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/puppet/).         

4. Verify the tarball or gem,               replacing <VERSION> with the Puppet               version number, and <FILE TYPE> with `tar.gz` for a tarball or `gem` for a Ruby gem: `gpg --verify puppet-<VERSION>.<FILE TYPE>.asc                  puppet-<VERSION>.<FILE TYPE>`            

   The output confirms that the signature matches:

   ```
   gpg: Signature made Mon 09 Nov 2020 12:19:14 PM PST using RSA key ID 9E61EF26
   gpg: Good signature from "Puppet, Inc. Release Key (Puppet, Inc. Release Key) <release@puppet.com>"Copied!
   ```

   Tip:  If you haven't set up a trust path to the key, you receive a                     warning that the key is not certified. If you’ve verified the fingerprint of                     the key, GPG has verified the archive’s integrity; the warning simply means                     that GPG can’t automatically prove the key’s ownership. 

## Verify an RPM package

RPM packages include an embedded signature, which you can        verify after importing the Puppet public key.



1. Import the public key: `gpg --keyserver                    hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371 --recv-key 4528B6CD9E61EF26`                

   Tip:  If this is your first time running the gpg tool, it might                            fail to import the key after creating its configuration file and                            keyring. You can run the command a second time to import the key into                            your newly created keyring.

   The gpg tool imports the                        key:

   ```
   gpg: /home/username/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
   gpg: key 4528B6CD9E61EF26: public key "Puppet, Inc. Release Key (Puppet, Inc. Release Key) <release@puppet.com>" imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1Copied!
   ```

2. Verify the fingerprint: `gpg --list-key --fingerprint                        4528B6CD9E61EF26`

   The fingerprint of the Puppet release signing                        key is `D681 1ED3 ADEE B844 1AF5 AA8F 4528 B6CD 9E61 EF26`. Ensure the                        fingerprint listed matches this value. 

3. ​                Retrieve the [Puppet public key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x7F438280EF8D349F) and place it in a                    file on your node.            

4. Use the RPM tool to import the public key, replacing <PUBLIC KEY                    FILE> with the path to the file containing the public key: `sudo                        rpm --import <PUBLIC KEY FILE>`

   The RPM tool doesn’t output anything if the command is                        successful.

5. Use the RPM tool to check the signature of a                    downloaded RPM package: `sudo rpm -vK <RPM_FILE_NAME>`                

   The embedded signature is verified and displays                        OK:

   ```
    puppet-agent-1.5.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm:
        Header V4 RSA/SHA512 Signature, key ID EF8D349F: OK
        Header SHA1 digest: OK (95b492a1fff452d029aaeb59598f1c78dbfee0c5)
        V4 RSA/SHA512 Signature, key ID EF8D349F: OK
        MD5 digest: OK (4878909ccdd0af24fa9909790dd63a12)Copied!
   ```

## Verify a macOS      `puppet-agent` package

`puppet-agent` packages for macOS are signed      with a developer ID and certificate. You can verify the package signature using the `pkgutil` tool or the      installer.

Use one of these methods to verify the package               signature:

- Download and mount the 

  ```
  puppet-agent
  ```

   disk image, and                  then use the 

  ```
  pkgutil
  ```

   tool to check the package's signature:                  

  ```
  /usr/bin/hdiutil attach puppet-agent-<AGENT-VERSION>-1.osx10.15.dmg
  ...
  pkgutil --check-signature /Volumes/puppet-agent-<AGENT-VERSION>-1.osx10.15/puppet-agent-<AGENT-VERSION>-1-installer.pkgCopied!
  ```

  The                  tool confirms the signature and outputs fingerprints for each certificate in the                  chain:

  ```
  Package "puppet-agent-<AGENT-VERSION>-1-installer.pkg":
     Status: signed by a developer certificate issued by Apple for distribution
     Certificate Chain:
      1. Developer ID Installer: PUPPET LABS, INC. (VKGLGN2B6Y)

             65 FA B2 19 4B 1E 2A B6 D1 9E

             F2 9C 88 CF B0 B1 BA 63 58 7F
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      3. Apple Root CA

             68 C5 BE 91 B5 A1 10 01 F0 24Copied!
  ```

- When you install the package, click the lock                  icon in the top right corner of the installer.

  The installer                     displays details about the package's certificate.
