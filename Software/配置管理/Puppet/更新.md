# Upgrading

To upgrade your deployment, you must upgrade both the        infrastructure components and agents.

The order in which you                upgrade components is important. Always upgrade Puppet Server and PuppetDB simultaneously, including the `puppetdb-termini` package on Puppet Server nodes, and always upgrade them before you                upgrade agent nodes. Do not run different major versions on your Puppet primary servers (including Server) and PuppetDB nodes. 

Important: Any time the `puppet-agent`                    package is updated, make sure to restart the `puppetserver` service afterward.

Note: These instructions cover upgrades in the versions 5, 6 and 7 series.                    For instructions on upgrading from version 3.8.x, see previous versions of the                    documentation.

# Upgrade Puppet Server

Upgrade Puppet Server to adopt        features and functionality of newer versions. 

Upgrading the `puppetserver` package effectively upgrades Puppet Server. The `puppetserver` package, in turn,                depends on the `puppet-agent` package, and your node’s package manager                automatically upgrades `puppet-agent` if the new version of `puppetserver` requires it.

Important: During an upgrade,                        Puppet Server doesn't perform its usual functions,                        including maintaining your site's infrastructure. If you use a single primary server,                    plan the timing of your upgrade accordingly and avoid reconfiguring any managed                    servers until your primary server is back up. If you use multiple load-balanced servers,                    upgrade them individually to avoid downtime or problems synchronizing                    configurations.

1. On your Puppet Server                    node, run the command appropriate to your package installer: 

   Yum:

   ```
   yum update puppetserverCopied!
   ```

   Apt:

   ```
   apt-get update
   apt-get install --only-upgrade puppetserverCopied!
   ```

2. If you pinned Puppet packages to a specific version, remove the pins.

   For yum packages locked with the `versionlock` plugin,                            edit `/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list` to remove the                        lock.

   On apt systems, remove `.pref` files from `/etc/apt/preferences.d/` that pin                    packages, and use the `apt-mark unhold` command on each held package.                

3. ​                After upgrading the `puppet-agent` package, make                    sure to restart the `puppetserver` service.            

# Upgrade agents

Regularly upgrade agents to keep your systems running        smoothly. 

Before you begin

Upgrade Puppet Server.

**[Upgrade agents using the puppet_agent module](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/upgrade_agents_module.html)**
Upgrade your Puppet agents using the             `puppetlabs/puppet_agent` module. The `puppet_agent`         module supports upgrading open source Puppet agents on *nix, Windows, and macOS  **[Upgrade \*nix agents](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/upgrade_nix_agents.html)**
We recommend using the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module when upgrading         between major versions of Puppet agent. To upgrade *nix without the module, you can use the system's package     manager. **[Upgrade Windows agents](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/upgrade_windows_agents.html)**
To upgrade Windows agents without the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module, reinstall the agent using the installation          instructions. You don't need to uninstall the agent before reinstalling  unless you’re         upgrading from 32-bit Puppet to the 64-bit         version. **[Upgrade macOS agents](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/upgrade_mac_os_x_agents.html)**
To upgrade macOS agents without the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module, use the `puppet          resource` command.

# Upgrade agents using the `puppet_agent` module

Upgrade your Puppet agents using the            `puppetlabs/puppet_agent` module. The `puppet_agent`        module supports upgrading open source Puppet agents on *nix, Windows, and macOS

Before you begin

Install the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module. Read about            installing modules in the following docs: 

- [Installing and managing modules from the command line](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/modules_installing.html#modules_installing)
- [Install modules on nodes without internet](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/modules_installing.html#modules_install_modules_no_internet)

CAUTION: Puppet 7                    changed the default `digest_algorithm` setting to                    sha256. To avoid breaking changes when upgrading, either disable remote                    filebuckets or make sure the agent has the same digest algorithm as `server` by changing the `digest_algorithm` setting on the agent to sha256.

To upgrade on a Puppet Server node:

1. ​                Add the `puppet_agent` class to agents you want to                    upgrade.            

2. Specify the desired `puppet_agent` package version and any other                    desired parameters described in the Forge in your                        `site.pp` file.

   Note: The `collection` parameter is required in Open Source Puppet.

   For example:                        

   ```
   # site.pp 
   node default {
     class { puppet_agent:
       package_version => '7.0.0',
       collection      => 'puppet7'
     }
   }Copied!
   ```

   This upgrades all of your Puppet Server managed                        nodes on the next agent run.

   To upgrade on a node that is **not** managed by Puppet Server, you must                        declare the class in your manifest. 

   For example, an upgrade manifest for a non-standard source looks                        like:

   ```
   # upgrade_file.pp
   class { puppet_agent:
     package_version => '7.0.0.224.gaf2034af',
     yum_source      => 'http://nightlies.puppet.com/yum',
     collection      => 'puppet7-nightly'
   }Copied!
   ```

   You then need to apply the manifest: `puppet apply                            upgrade_file.pp`

# Upgrade *nix agents

We recommend using the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module when upgrading        between major versions of Puppet agent. To upgrade *nix without the module, you can use the system's package    manager.

Before upgrading to another major version, ensure that you have installed the            appropriate release package for your platform. You can find release packages for            supported platforms at [yum.puppet.com](http://yum.puppet.com) and [apt.puppet.com](https://apt.puppet.com/). We also provide nightly            release packages at [nightlies.puppet.com](http://nightlies.puppet.com).

On the agent node, run the command appropriate to your system's package                    installer: 

Yum                        (EL/Fedora):

```
yum update puppet-agentCopied!
```

Zypper (SLES)

```
zypper up puppet-agentCopied!
```

Apt                        (Debian/Ubuntu):

```
apt-get update
apt-get install --only-upgrade puppet-agent
```

# Upgrade Windows agents

To upgrade Windows agents without the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module, reinstall the agent using the installation        instructions. You don't need to uninstall the agent before reinstalling unless you’re        upgrading from 32-bit Puppet to the 64-bit        version.

# Upgrade macOS agents

To upgrade macOS agents without the [puppetlabs/puppet_agent](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) module, use the `puppet         resource` command.

Before you begin

[Download](https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/mac/) the appropriate agent DMG. 

Use the package resource provider for macOS to install the agent from a disk image: 

```
sudo puppet resource package "<NAME>.dmg" ensure=present source=<FULL PATH TO DMG>Copie
```

# Upgrade PuppetDB

Upgrade PuppetDB to get the      newest features available. 



1. Follow these steps, depending on whether you want to               automate upgrade or manually upgrade.

   - To automate upgrade, specify                              the `version` parameter of the `puppetlabs/puppetdb` module’s `puppetdb::globals` class.

   - To manually upgrade, on the PuppetDB node, run the command appropriate                           to your package installer:

     Yum:

     ```
     yum update puppetdbCopied!
     ```

     Apt:

     ```
     apt-get update
     apt-get install --only-upgrade puppetdbCopied!
     ```

2. On your primary server, upgrade the `puppetdb-termini` package by running the               command appropriate to your package installer:

   Yum:

   ```
   yum update puppetdb-terminiCopied!
   ```

   Apt:

   ```
   apt-get update
   apt-get install --only-upgrade puppetdb-termini
   ```
