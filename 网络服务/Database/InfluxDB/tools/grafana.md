Grafana is a convenient dashboard tool for visuallizing time series data. It was originally built for Graphite, modeled after Kibana, and since been updated to support InfluxDB.

The [Grafana's InfluxDB data source documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/influxdb/) has more information on how to set up Grafana with InfluxDB v0.9.
