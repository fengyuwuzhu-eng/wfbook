# OpenLDAP
 ![](../../../../Image/LDAPlogo.gif)



OpenLDAP使用Berkeley DB并行/事务数据库软件。

## 配置选择
1. 本地目录服务  
![](../../../../Image/config_local.png)
2. 带转发的本地服务  
![](../../../../Image/config_ref.png)
3. 可复制的目录服务  
![](../../../../Image/config_repl.png)
4. 分布式本地目录服务

## 安装

OpenLdap是基于LDAP协议的开源程序，它的程序名称叫做slapd。

### 服务端

```bash
yum install -y openldap openldap-clients openldap-servers migrationtools
```

生成密钥文件（记下生成出的值，后面要用）：

```bash
slappasswd -s linuxprobe -n > /etc/openldap/passwd
cat /etc/openldap/passwd 
{SSHA}v/GJvGG8SbIuCxhfTDVhkmWEuz2afNIR
```

写入一条主机与IP地址的解析记录：

```bash
echo "192.168.10.10 instructor.linuxprobe.com" >> /etc/hosts
```

因为LDAP目录服务是以明文的方式在网络中传输数据的（包括密码），所以采用TLS加密机制来解决这个问题，使用openssl工具生成X509格式的证书文件（有效期为365天）：

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out  /etc/openldap/certs/cert.pem -keyout /etc/openldap/certs/priv.pem -days  365
```


修改证书的所属与权限：

```bash
cd /etc/openldap/certs/
chown ldap:ldap *
chmod 600 priv.pem

ls -al
-rw-r--r--. 1 ldap ldap 1318 Oct 5 13:41 cert.pem
-rw-------. 1 ldap ldap 1704 Oct 5 13:41 priv.pem
```

复制一份LDAP的配置模板：

```bash
cp /usr/share/openldap-servers/DB_CONFIG.example /var/lib/ldap/DB_CONFIG
```

生成数据库文件（不用担心报错信息）：

```bash
slaptest 
5610aaa9 hdb_db_open: database "dc=my-domain,dc=com": db_open(/var/lib/ldap/id2entry.bdb) failed: No such file or directory (2).
5610aaa9 backend_startup_one (type=hdb, suffix="dc=my-domain,dc=com"): bi_db_open failed! (2)
slap_startup failed (test would succeed using the -u switch)
```

修改LDAP数据库的所属主与组：

```bash
chown ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap/*
```

启动slapd服务程序并设置为开机启动：

```bash
systemctl restart slapd
systemctl enable slapd
```

在LDAP目录服务中使用**LDIF**(LDAP **I**nterchange **F**ormat)格式来保存信息，而LDIF是一种标准的文本文件且可以随意的导入导出，所以我们需要有一种“格式”标准化LDIF文件的写法，这中格式叫做“schema”，schema用于指定一个目录中所包含对象的类型，以及每一个类型中的可选属性，我们可以将schema理解为面向对象程序设计中的“类”，通过“类”定义出具体的对象，因此其实LDIF数据条目则都是通过schema数据模型创建出来的具体对象：

**ldapadd[命令](https://www.linuxcool.com/)用于将LDIF文件导入到目录服务数据库中，格式为：“ldapadd [参数] LDIF文件”。**

| 参数 | 作用                             |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| -x   | 进行简单认证。                   |
| -D   | 用于绑定服务器的dn。             |
| -h： | 目录服务的地址。                 |
| -w： | 绑定dn的密码。                   |
| -f： | 使用LDIF文件进行条目添加的文件。 |


 添加cosine和nis模块：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# cd /etc/openldap/schema/
[root@linuxprobe schema]# ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -D "cn=config" -f cosine.ldif
SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started
SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
SASL SSF: 0
adding new entry "cn=cosine,cn=schema,cn=config"
[root@linuxprobe schema]# ldapadd -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -D "cn=config" -f nis.ldif
SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started
SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
SASL SSF: 0
adding new entry "cn=nis,cn=schema,cn=config"
```

创建/etc/openldap/changes.ldif文件，并将下面的信息复制进去（注意有一处要修改的地方）：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# vim /etc/openldap/changes.ldif
dn: olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcSuffix
olcSuffix: dc=linuxprobe,dc=com

dn: olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcRootDN
olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com

dn: olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcRootPW
olcRootPW: 此处输入之前生成的密码（如{SSHA}v/GJvGG8SbIuCxhfTDVhkmWEuz2afNIR）

dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcTLSCertificateFile
olcTLSCertificateFile: /etc/openldap/certs/cert.pem

dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcTLSCertificateKeyFile
olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: /etc/openldap/certs/priv.pem

dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcLogLevel
olcLogLevel: -1

dn: olcDatabase={1}monitor,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcAccess
olcAccess: {0}to * by dn.base="gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth" read by dn.base="cn=Manager,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com" read by * none
```

将新的配置文件更新到slapd服务程序：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f /etc/openldap/changes.ldif
SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started
SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
SASL SSF: 0
modifying entry "olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config"
modifying entry "olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config"
modifying entry "olcDatabase={2}hdb,cn=config"
modifying entry "cn=config"
modifying entry "cn=config"
modifying entry "cn=config"
modifying entry "olcDatabase={1}monitor,cn=config"
```

创建/etc/openldap/base.ldif文件，并将下面的信息复制进去：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# vim /etc/openldap/base.ldif
dn: dc=linuxprobe,dc=com
dc: linuxprobe
objectClass: top
objectClass: domain

dn: ou=People,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com
ou: People
objectClass: top
objectClass: organizationalUnit

dn: ou=Group,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com
ou: Group
objectClass: top
objectClass: organizationalUnit
```

创建目录的结构服务：
 [cc lang="bash"]
 [root@linuxprobe ~]# ldapadd -x -w linuxprobe -D cn=Manager,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com -f /etc/openldap/base.ldif
 adding new entry "dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 adding new entry "ou=People,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 adding new entry "ou=Group,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 [/cc]
 创建测试用的用户：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# useradd -d /home/ldap ldapuser
```

设置帐户的迁移（修改第71与74行）：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# vim /usr/share/migrationtools/migrate_common.ph
$DEFAULT_MAIL_DOMAIN = "linuxprobe.com";
$DEFAULT_BASE = "dc=linuxprobe,dc=com";
```

将当前系统中的用户迁移至目录服务：
 [cc lang="bash"]
 [root@linuxprobe ~]# cd /usr/share/migrationtools/
 [root@linuxprobe migrationtools]# grep ":10[0-9][0-9]" /etc/passwd > passwd
 [root@linuxprobe migrationtools]# ./migrate_passwd.pl passwd users.ldif
 [root@linuxprobe migrationtools]# ldapadd -x -w linuxprobe -D cn=Manager,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com -f users.ldif
 adding new entry "uid=linuxprobe,ou=People,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 adding new entry "uid=ldapuser,ou=People,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 [/cc]
 将当前系统中的用户组迁移至目录服务：
 [cc lang="bash"]
 [root@linuxprobe migrationtools]# grep ":10[0-9][0-9]" /etc/group > group
 [root@linuxprobe migrationtools]# ./migrate_group.pl group groups.ldif
 [root@linuxprobe migrationtools]# ldapadd -x -w linuxprobe -D cn=Manager,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com -f groups.ldif
 adding new entry "cn=linuxprobe,ou=Group,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 adding new entry "cn=ldapuser,ou=Group,dc=linuxprobe,dc=com"
 [/cc]
 测试linuxprobe用户的配置文件：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# ldapsearch -x cn=ldapuser -b dc=linuxprobe,dc=com

 填写证书地址：
 ![第23章 使用OpenLDAP部署目录服务。第23章 使用OpenLDAP部署目录服务。](https://www.linuxprobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RHEL7-2-2015-10-30-09-28-00.png)
 稍等片刻后，验证本地是否已经有了ldapuser用户：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# id ldapuser
uid=1001(ldapuser) gid=1001(ldapuser) groups=1001(ldapuser)
```

此时说明已经可以通过LDAP服务端验证了，并且ldapuser用户的帐号信息也不会保存在您本地的/etc/passwd文件中~

##### **23.3 自动挂载用户目录**

虽然在客户端已经能够使用LDAP验证帐户了，但是当切换到ldapuser用户时会提示没有该用户的家目录：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# su - ldapuser
su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/ldapuser: No such file or directory
mkdir: cannot create directory '/home/ldapuser': Permission denied
```

原因是本机并没有该用户的家目录，我们需要配置NFS服务将用户的家目录自动挂载过来：

在LDAP服务端添加共享信息（NFS服务程序已经默认安装，我们之前学过还记得吗？）：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# vim /etc/exports
/home/ldap 192.168.10.20 (rw,sync,root_squash)
```

重启nfs-server服务程序：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# systemctl restart nfs-server
```

在LDAP客户端查看共享信息：

```
[root@linuxprobe ldap]# showmount -e 192.168.10.10
Export list for 192.168.10.10:
/home/ldap 192.168.10.20
```

将共享目录挂载到本地：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# mkdir /home/ldap
[root@linuxprobe ldap]# mount -t nfs 192.168.10.10:/home/ldap /home/ldap
```

再次尝试切换到ldapuser用户，这样非常顺利：

```
[root@linuxprobe ldap]# su - ldapuser
Last login: Tue Oct  6 11:51:25 CST 2015 on pts/3
[ldapuser@linuxprobe ~]$
```

设置为开机自动挂载：

```
[root@linuxprobe ~]# vim /etc/fstab
192.168.10.10:/home/ldap /home/ldap nfs defaults 0 0
```

​                         



## 安装

### 服务器配置

1.安装OpenLDAP软件

CentOS:

    yum install openldap-servers    #服务端
    yum install openldap-clients    #客户端
    yum install openldap            #Openldap库    
    yum install db4                 #貌似现在不需要了

2.启动LDAP服务

CentOS 6：

    service slapd start
    chkconfig slapd on

CentOS 7:

    systemctl start slapd.service
    systemctl enable slapd.service

3.防火墙开启389端口

4.复制配置文件

    cp /usr/share/openldap-servers/DB_CONFIG.example /var/lib/ldap/DB_CONFIG
    cp /usr/share/openldap-servers/slapd.conf.obsolete /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

5.生成管理员密码：

    slappasswd
    New password:
    Re-enter new password:
    {SSHA}pxQv4Dm30PtHT1x9uyvS364m0jrBwwbQ

6.编辑配置文件

7.测试和生成配置文件

8.重启服务：

    service slapd restart

9.用以下命令查询服务器:
   ldapsearch -x -b '' -s base '(objectclass=*)' namingContexts
   如果命令执行成功，返回一些信息，则说明服务器正常运行了。


## OpenLDAP web管理界面（ldap account Manager）



如果总是提示密码错误，操作如下
1.rm –rf /etc/openldap/slapd.d/*
2.slaptest –f /etc/openldap/slapd.conf –F /etc/openldap/slapd.d
3.chown –R ldap:ldap /etc/openldap/slapd.d
4.chmod –R 000  /etc/openldap/slapd.d
5.chmod –R u+rwx  /etc/openldap/slapd.d
6.删除slapd.conf



导入到LDAP:

    # ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f /tmp/base.ldif  

. 你将收到提示输入密码，也就是在slapd.conf中定义的"secret". 例如, 对于 example.com, 使用:
            ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f example.ldif
10. 看它是否起作用.
现在我们准备检验目录中添加的条目. 你可使用任何LDAP客户端来做这件事, 但我们的例子使用ldapsearch(1)工具. 记住把 dc=example,dc=com 替换成你的网站的正确的值:`ldapsearch -x -b 'dc=example,dc=com' '(objectclass=*)'`


### Client
打开客户端图形化界面命令行，输入system-config-authentication保存退出，系统会自动重启sssd服务。
注意：LDAP服务需要服务器和客户端的时间保持大致一致，否则在登陆ldapuser1账户时可能会报错。

## 依赖的软件

### 传输层安全
客户端和服务器需要安装OpenSSL或GnuTLS的TLS库来提供TLS，传输层安全服务。

### 简单验证和安全层
客户端和服务器需要安装 Cyrus SASL 库提供简单身份认证和安全层服务。Cyrus SASL 将使用 OpenSSL 和 Kerberos/GSSAPI 库。

### Kerberos验证服务
OpenLDAP支持 Kerberos V GSS-API SASL 认证机制，称为GSSAPI机制。此功能要求，除了Cyrus SASL 库之外，还要有 Heimdal 或 MIT Kerberos V 库。

### 数据库软件
OpenLDAP的slapd （ 8 ）的BDB和HDB主要数据库后端需要甲骨文公司的Berkeley DB。

### 线程
OpenLDAP支持POSIX pthreads，Mach CThreads ，以及其他一些品种。

### TCP包装

支持 TCP 包装 (IP 级访问控制过滤)。建议为包含非公开信息的服务器使用 TCP 包装或其他 IP级的访问过滤 (例如那些IP级防火墙所提供的).




## 配置slapd
旧风格slapd.conf （ 5 ）文件仍然是支持的，但必须转换为新的slapd配置（ 5 ）格式，允许运行时改变被保存。虽然旧的风格配置使用一个单一的文件，通常安装在/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf ，新的风格采用了slapd后端数据库来存储配置。配置数据库通常放在/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d目录。从 slapd.conf格式转换成slapd.d格式时，任何包含文件也将被集成到由此产生的配置数据库。一些后端和分布式覆盖还不支持运行时配置。在这种情况下，旧式slapd.conf （ 5 ）文件必须使用。

### 配置布局

![](../../../../Image/config_dit.png)

树的根被命名为 cn=config，并且包含全球配置设置。其他设置均包含在独立的子条目中：
动态装载模块
这些可能只在使用了 --enable-modules 选项 configure 软件的时候需要用.
规划定义
cn=schema,cn=config 条目包含了系统的规划(在slapd中所有规划都是硬编码).
cn=schema,cn=config 的子条目包含从配置文件装载或运行时添加的的用户规划.
特定后端配置
特定数据库配置
Overlay被定义在数据库条目的子条目下.
数据库和Overlay也可以有其他的杂项子条目.

### LDIF文件
'＃'字符开始的注释行会被忽略。如果一行的开始是一个空格，它被认为是延续前行（即使前行是注释）并且这个单个的空格会被删除。条目是由空白行分开的。
config LDIF的总体布局如下：
        # 全球配置设定
        dn: cn=config
        objectClass: olcGlobal
        cn: config
        <global config settings>

        # 规划定义
        dn: cn=schema,cn=config
        objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
        cn: schema
        <system schema>
    
        dn: cn={X}core,cn=schema,cn=config
        objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
        cn: {X}core
        <core schema>
    
        # 额外的用户定义的规划
        ...
    
        # 后端定义
        dn: olcBackend=<typeA>,cn=config
        objectClass: olcBackendConfig
        olcBackend: <typeA>
        <backend-specific settings>
    
        # 数据库定义
        dn: olcDatabase={X}<typeA>,cn=config
        objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
        olcDatabase: {X}<typeA>
        <database-specific settings>
    
        # 随后的定义和设置
        ...

一些以上所列项目在他们的名字有一个数字索引"{X}"。虽然大多数配置设置具有内在的次序依赖（即一个设置必须在另一个设定之前生效），LDAP 数据库本身是无次序的。这个数字索引是用来在配置数据库强制一致性的次序，以便使所有的次序依赖被保存。在大多数情况下，并没有提供索引，它将根据条目创 建的顺序自动生成。
配置指令被定义为一个独立属性的值。大部分用于slapd配置的属性和objectClasses在他们的名字有一个“olc”前缀 （ OpenLDAP配置）。通常在属性和旧式slapd.conf配置关键字之间有一对一的对应关系，使用关键字作为属性名称，以“olc”作前缀。
一个配置指令可采用参数。如果是这样，参数们由空格分开。如果参数包含空格，这个参数应包含在双引号里“像这样” 。在以下描述中，在方括号<>中的参数应被实际的文字替换 。
发布版包含一个配置文件例子，将被安装在/usr/local/etc/OpenLDAP目录。在/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema目录还提供了一些包含架构定义（属性类型和对象类）的文件。

### 配置指令

#### cn=config

此项目中所载的指令一般适用于把服务器作为一个整体。他们中的大多数是系统或面向连接的，而不是数据库相关的。此项目必须有olcGlobal对象。
olcIdleTimeout: <integer>

指定强行关闭闲置客户端连接等待的秒数。默认情况下，值为0，禁用此功能。
olcLogLevel: <level>

该指令规定在哪一级的调试和运行统计报表应syslogged （目前记录到syslogd （ 8 ） LOG_LOCAL4设施）。您必须配置OpenLDAP -enable-debug（默认）为工作（除了这两个统计级别，是始终启用的）。日志级别可能会被指定为整数或关键字。可使用多重记录级别并且级别是可 添加的。要显示哪些层次对应于什么样的调试，以 -D? 调用 slapd 或参考下表。<level>可能的值有：

| 级别   | 关键字          | 描述                           |
|-------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| -1    | any            | enable all debugging           |

是等效的.

olcReferral <URI>

This directive specifies the referral to pass back when slapd cannot find a local database to handle a request.
Example:
       olcReferral: ldap://root.openldap.org
This will refer non-local queries to the global root LDAP server at the OpenLDAP Project. Smart LDAP clients can re-ask their query at that server, but note that most of these clients are only going to know how to handle simple LDAP URLs that contain a host part and optionally a distinguished name part.

#### cn=module

If support for dynamically loaded modules was enabled when configuring slapd, cn=module entries may be used to specify sets of modules to load. Module entries must have the olcModuleList objectClass.
olcModuleLoad: <filename>

Specify the name of a dynamically loadable module to load. The filename may be an absolute path name or a simple filename. Non-absolute names are searched for in the directories specified by the olcModulePath directive.
olcModulePath: <pathspec>

Specify a list of directories to search for loadable modules. Typically the path is colon-separated but this depends on the operating system.

#### cn=schema

The cn=schema entry holds all of the schema definitions that are hard-coded in slapd. As such, the values in this entry are generated by slapd so no schema values need to be provided in the config file. The entry must still be defined though, to serve as a base for the user-defined schema to add in underneath. Schema entries must have the olcSchemaConfig objectClass.
olcAttributeTypes: <RFC4512 Attribute Type Description>

This directive defines an attribute type. Please see the Schema Specification chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.
olcObjectClasses: <RFC4512 Object Class Description>

This directive defines an object class. Please see the Schema Specification chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.

#### 具体后端指令

Backend directives apply to all database instances of the same type and, depending on the directive, may be overridden by database directives. Backend entries must have the olcBackendConfig objectClass.
olcBackend: <type>

This directive names a backend-specific configuration entry. <type> should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table.

| Types  | Description                                           |

#### 特定数据库

Directives in this section are supported by every type of database. Database entries must have the olcDatabaseConfig objectClass.
olcDatabase: [{<index>}]<type>

This directive names a specific database instance. The numeric {<index>} may be provided to distinguish multiple databases of the same type. Usually the index can be omitted, and slapd will generate it automatically. <type> should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 5.2 or the frontend type.
The frontend is a special database that is used to hold database-level options that should be applied to all the other databases. Subsequent database definitions may also override some frontend settings.
The config database is also special; both the config and the frontend databases are always created implicitly even if they are not explicitly configured, and they are created before any other databases.
Example:
       olcDatabase: bdb
This marks the beginning of a new BDB database instance.
olcAccess: to <what> [ by <who> [<accesslevel>] [<control>] ]+

This directive grants access (specified by <accesslevel>) to a set of entries and/or attributes (specified by <what>) by one or more requestors (specified by <who>). See the Access Control section of this guide for basic usage.
Note: If no olcAccess directives are specified, the default access control policy, to * by * read, allows all users (both authenticated and anonymous) read access.
Note: Access controls defined in the frontend are appended to all other databases' controls.
olcReadonly { TRUE | FALSE }

This directive puts the database into "read-only" mode. Any attempts to modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.
Default:
       olcReadonly: FALSE
olcRootDN: <DN>

This directive specifies the DN that is not subject to access control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database. The DN need not refer to an entry in this database or even in the directory. The DN may refer to a SASL identity.
Entry-based Example:
       olcRootDN: "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
SASL-based Example:
       olcRootDN: "uid=root,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth"
See the SASL Authentication section for information on SASL authentication identities.
olcRootPW: <password>

This directive can be used to specify a password for the DN for the rootdn (when the rootdn is set to a DN within the database).
Example:
       olcRootPW: secret
It is also permissible to provide a hash of the password in RFC2307 form. slappasswd(8) may be used to generate the password hash.
Example:
       olcRootPW: {SSHA}ZKKuqbEKJfKSXhUbHG3fG8MDn9j1v4QN
The hash was generated using the command slappasswd -s secret.
olcSizeLimit: <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.
Default:
       olcSizeLimit: 500
See the Limits section of this guide and slapd-config(5) for more details.
olcSuffix: <dn suffix>

This directive specifies the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend database. Multiple suffix lines can be given, and usually at least one is required for each database definition. (Some backend types, such as frontend and monitor use a hard-coded suffix which may not be overridden in the configuration.)
Example:
       olcSuffix: "dc=example,dc=com"
Queries with a DN ending in "dc=example,dc=com" will be passed to this backend.
Note: When the backend to pass a query to is selected, slapd looks at the suffix value(s) in each database definition in the order in which they were configured. Thus, if one database suffix is a prefix of another, it must appear after it in the configuration.

这个指令定义当前数据库作为一个主服务器内容的复制，通过当前的slapd(8) 建立一个运行syncrepl复制引擎的复制消费者站点. 主数据库由provider参数定位于复制提供者站点. 复制数据库使用LDAP内容同步协议保持对主服务器内容的更新. 关于协议的更多信息参见 RFC4533.
The rid parameter is used for identification of the current syncrepl directive within the replication consumer server, where <replica ID> uniquely identifies the syncrepl specification described by the current syncrepl directive. <replica ID> is non-negative and is no more than three decimal digits in length.
The provider parameter specifies the replication provider site containing the master content as an LDAP URI. The provider parameter specifies a scheme, a host and optionally a port where the provider slapd instance can be found. Either a domain name or IP address may be used for <hostname>. Examples are ldap://provider.example.com:389 or ldaps://192.168.1.1:636. If <port> is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used. Note that the syncrepl uses a consumer-initiated protocol, and hence its specification is located at the consumer site, whereas the replica specification is located at the provider site. syncrepl and replica directives define two independent replication mechanisms. They do not represent the replication peers of each other.
The content of the syncrepl replica is defined using a search specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send search requests to the provider slapd according to the search specification. The search specification includes searchbase, scope, filter, attrs, attrsonly, sizelimit, and timelimit parameters as in the normal search specification. The searchbase parameter has no default value and must always be specified. The scope defaults to sub, the filter defaults to (objectclass=*), attrs defaults to "*,+" to replicate all user and operational attributes, and attrsonly is unset by default. Both sizelimit and timelimit default to "unlimited", and only positive integers or "unlimited" may be specified.
The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types: refreshOnly and refreshAndPersist. The operation type is specified by the type parameter. In the refreshOnly operation, the next synchronization search operation is periodically rescheduled at an interval time after each synchronization operation finishes. The interval is specified by the interval parameter. It is set to one day by default. In the refreshAndPersist operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the provider slapd instance. Further updates to the master replica will generate searchResultEntry to the consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent synchronization search.
If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt to reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of the <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs. For example, retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next three times before stop retrying. + in <# of retries> means indefinite number of retries until success.
The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site by turning on the schemachecking parameter. If it is turned on, every replicated entry will be checked for its schema as the entry is stored into the replica content. Every entry in the replica should contain those attributes required by the schema definition. If it is turned off, entries will be stored without checking schema conformance. The default is off.
The binddn parameter gives the DN to bind as for the syncrepl searches to the provider slapd. It should be a DN which has read access to the replication content in the master database.
The bindmethod is simple or sasl, depending on whether simple password-based authentication or SASL authentication is to be used when connecting to the provider slapd instance.
Simple authentication should not be used unless adequate data integrity and confidentiality protections are in place (e.g. TLS or IPsec). Simple authentication requires specification of binddn and credentials parameters.
SASL authentication is generally recommended. SASL authentication requires specification of a mechanism using the saslmech parameter. Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using authcid and credentials, respectively. The authzid parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.
The realm parameter specifies a realm which a certain mechanisms authenticate the identity within. The secprops parameter specifies Cyrus SASL security properties.
The starttls parameter specifies use of the StartTLS extended operation to establish a TLS session before authenticating to the provider. If the critical argument is supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session continues without TLS. Note that the main slapd TLS settings are not used by the syncrepl engine; by default the TLS parameters from a ldap.conf(5) configuration file will be used. TLS settings may be specified here, in which case any ldap.conf(5) settings will be completely ignored.
Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs of data modifications. This mode of operation is referred to as delta syncrepl. In addition to the above parameters, the logbase and logfilter parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will be used. The syncdata parameter must be set to either "accesslog" if the log conforms to the slapo-accesslog(5) log format, or "changelog" if the log conforms to the obsolete changelog format. If the syncdata parameter is omitted or set to "default" then the log parameters are ignored.
The syncrepl replication mechanism is supported by the bdb and hdb backends.
See the LDAP Sync Replication chapter of this guide for more information on how to use this directive.
olcTimeLimit: <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will spend answering a search request. If a request is not finished in this time, a result indicating an exceeded timelimit will be returned.
Default:
       olcTimeLimit: 3600
See the Limits section of this guide and slapd-config(5) for more details.
olcUpdateref: <URL>

This directive is only applicable in a slave slapd. It specifies the URL to return to clients which submit update requests upon the replica. If specified multiple times, each URL is provided.
Example:
       olcUpdateref:   ldap://master.example.net
Sample Entries

dn: olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig objectClass: olcFrontendConfig olcDatabase: frontend olcReadOnly: FALSE
dn: olcDatabase=config,cn=config objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig olcDatabase: config olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
#### BDB和HDB数据库指令

Directives in this category apply to both the BDB and the HDB database. They are used in an olcDatabase entry in addition to the generic database directives defined above. For a complete reference of BDB/HDB configuration directives, see slapd-bdb(5). In addition to the olcDatabaseConfig objectClass, BDB and HDB database entries must have the olcBdbConfig and olcHdbConfig objectClass, respectively.
olcDbDirectory: <directory>

This directive specifies the directory where the BDB files containing the database and associated indices live.
Default:
       olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
olcDbCachesize: <integer>

This directive specifies the size in entries of the in-memory cache maintained by the BDB backend database instance.
Default:
       olcDbCachesize: 1000
olcDbCheckpoint: <kbyte> <min>

This directive specifies how often to checkpoint the BDB transaction log. A checkpoint operation flushes the database buffers to disk and writes a checkpoint record in the log. The checkpoint will occur if either <kbyte> data has been written or <min> minutes have passed since the last checkpoint. Both arguments default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When the <min> argument is non-zero, an internal task will run every <min> minutes to perform the checkpoint. See the Berkeley DB reference guide for more details.
Example:
       olcDbCheckpoint: 1024 10
olcDbConfig: <DB_CONFIG setting>

This attribute specifies a configuration directive to be placed in the DB_CONFIG file of the database directory. At server startup time, if no such file exists yet, the DB_CONFIG file will be created and the settings in this attribute will be written to it. If the file exists, its contents will be read and displayed in this attribute. The attribute is multi-valued, to accommodate multiple configuration directives. No default is provided, but it is essential to use proper settings here to get the best server performance.
Any changes made to this attribute will be written to the DB_CONFIG file and will cause the database environment to be reset so the changes can take immediate effect. If the environment cache is large and has not been recently checkpointed, this reset operation may take a long time. It may be advisable to manually perform a single checkpoint using the Berkeley DB db_checkpoint utility before using LDAP Modify to change this attribute.
Example:
       olcDbConfig: set_cachesize 0 10485760 0
       olcDbConfig: set_lg_bsize 2097512
       olcDbConfig: set_lg_dir /var/tmp/bdb-log
       olcDbConfig: set_flags DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE
In this example, the BDB cache is set to 10MB, the BDB transaction log buffer size is set to 2MB, and the transaction log files are to be stored in the /var/tmp/bdb-log directory. Also a flag is set to tell BDB to delete transaction log files as soon as their contents have been checkpointed and they are no longer needed. Without this setting the transaction log files will continue to accumulate until some other cleanup procedure removes them. See the Berkeley DB documentation for the db_archive command for details. For a complete list of Berkeley DB flags please see - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/api_c/env_set_flags.html
Ideally the BDB cache must be at least as large as the working set of the database, the log buffer size should be large enough to accommodate most transactions without overflowing, and the log directory must be on a separate physical disk from the main database files. And both the database directory and the log directory should be separate from disks used for regular system activities such as the root, boot, or swap filesystems. See the FAQ-o-Matic and the Berkeley DB documentation for more details.
olcDbNosync: { TRUE | FALSE }

This option causes on-disk database contents to not be immediately synchronized with in memory changes upon change. Setting this option to TRUE may improve performance at the expense of data integrity. This directive has the same effect as using
       olcDbConfig: set_flags DB_TXN_NOSYNC
olcDbIDLcacheSize: <integer>

Specify the size of the in-memory index cache, in index slots. The default is zero. A larger value will speed up frequent searches of indexed entries. The optimal size will depend on the data and search characteristics of the database, but using a number three times the entry cache size is a good starting point.
Example:
       olcDbIDLcacheSize: 3000
olcDbIndex: {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

This directive specifies the indices to maintain for the given attribute. If only an <attrlist> is given, the default indices are maintained. The index keywords correspond to the common types of matches that may be used in an LDAP search filter.
Example:
       olcDbIndex: default pres,eq
       olcDbIndex: uid
       olcDbIndex: cn,sn pres,eq,sub
       olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
The first line sets the default set of indices to maintain to present and equality. The second line causes the default (pres,eq) set of indices to be maintained for the uid attribute type. The third line causes present, equality, and substring indices to be maintained for cn and sn attribute types. The fourth line causes an equality index for the objectClass attribute type.
There is no index keyword for inequality matches. Generally these matches do not use an index. However, some attributes do support indexing for inequality matches, based on the equality index.
A substring index can be more explicitly specified as subinitial, subany, or subfinal, corresponding to the three possible components of a substring match filter. A subinitial index only indexes substrings that appear at the beginning of an attribute value. A subfinal index only indexes substrings that appear at the end of an attribute value, while subany indexes substrings that occur anywhere in a value.
Note that by default, setting an index for an attribute also affects every subtype of that attribute. E.g., setting an equality index on the name attribute causes cn, sn, and every other attribute that inherits from name to be indexed.
By default, no indices are maintained. It is generally advised that minimally an equality index upon objectClass be maintained.
       olcDbindex: objectClass eq
Additional indices should be configured corresponding to the most common searches that are used on the database. Presence indexing should not be configured for an attribute unless the attribute occurs very rarely in the database, and presence searches on the attribute occur very frequently during normal use of the directory. Most applications don't use presence searches, so usually presence indexing is not very useful.
If this setting is changed while slapd is running, an internal task will be run to generate the changed index data. All server operations can continue as normal while the indexer does its work. If slapd is stopped before the index task completes, indexing will have to be manually completed using the slapindex tool.
olcDbLinearIndex: { TRUE | FALSE }

If this setting is TRUE slapindex will index one attribute at a time. The default settings is FALSE in which case all indexed attributes of an entry are processed at the same time. When enabled, each indexed attribute is processed individually, using multiple passes through the entire database. This option improves slapindex performance when the database size exceeds the BDB cache size. When the BDB cache is large enough, this option is not needed and will decrease performance. Also by default, slapadd performs full indexing and so a separate slapindex run is not needed. With this option, slapadd does no indexing and slapindex must be used.
olcDbMode: { <octal> | <symbolic> }

This directive specifies the file protection mode that newly created database index files should have. This can be in the form 0600 or -rw-------
Default:
       olcDbMode: 0600
olcDbSearchStack: <integer>

Specify the depth of the stack used for search filter evaluation. Search filters are evaluated on a stack to accommodate nested AND / OR clauses. An individual stack is allocated for each server thread. The depth of the stack determines how complex a filter can be evaluated without requiring any additional memory allocation. Filters that are nested deeper than the search stack depth will cause a separate stack to be allocated for that particular search operation. These separate allocations can have a major negative impact on server performance, but specifying too much stack will also consume a great deal of memory. Each search uses 512K bytes per level on a 32-bit machine, or 1024K bytes per level on a 64-bit machine. The default stack depth is 16, thus 8MB or 16MB per thread is used on 32 and 64 bit machines, respectively. Also the 512KB size of a single stack slot is set by a compile-time constant which may be changed if needed; the code must be recompiled for the change to take effect.
Default:
       olcDbSearchStack: 16
olcDbShmKey: <integer>

Specify a key for a shared memory BDB environment. By default the BDB environment uses memory mapped files. If a non-zero value is specified, it will be used as the key to identify a shared memory region that will house the environment.
Example:
       olcDbShmKey: 42

5.4. Converting old style slapd.conf(5) file to cn=config format

Before converting to the cn=config format you should make sure that the config backend is properly configured in your existing config file. While the config backend is always present inside slapd, by default it is only accessible by its rootDN, and there are no default credentials assigned so unless you explicitly configure a means to authenticate to it, it will be unusable.

If you do not already have a database config section, add something like this to the end of slapd.conf

 database config
 rootpw VerySecret

Note: Since the config backend can be used to load arbitrary code into the slapd process, it is extremely important to carefully guard whatever credentials are used to access it. Since simple passwords are vulnerable to password guessing attacks, it is usually better to omit the rootpw and only use SASL authentication for the config rootDN.

An existing slapd.conf(5) file can be converted to the new format using slaptest(8) or any of the slap tools:

        slaptest -f /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d

Test that you can access entries under cn=config using the default rootdn and the rootpw configured above:

        ldapsearch -x -D cn=config -w VerySecret -b cn=config

You can then discard the old slapd.conf(5) file. Make sure to launch slapd(8) with the -F option to specify the configuration directory if you are not using the default directory path.

Note: When converting from the slapd.conf format to slapd.d format, any included files will also be integrated into the resulting configuration database.

6. The slapd Configuration File

This chapter describes configuring slapd(8) via the slapd.conf(5) configuration file. slapd.conf(5) has been deprecated and should only be used if your site requires one of the backends that hasn't yet been updated to work with the newer slapd-config(5) system. Configuring slapd(8) via slapd-config(5) is described in the previous chapter.

The slapd.conf(5) file is normally installed in the /usr/local/etc/openldap directory. An alternate configuration file location can be specified via a command-line option to slapd(8).
6.1. Configuration File Format

The slapd.conf(5) file consists of three types of configuration information: global, backend specific, and database specific. Global information is specified first, followed by information associated with a particular backend type, which is then followed by information associated with a particular database instance. Global directives can be overridden in backend and/or database directives, and backend directives can be overridden by database directives.

Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a '#' character are ignored. If a line begins with whitespace, it is considered a continuation of the previous line (even if the previous line is a comment).

The general format of slapd.conf is as follows:

        # global configuration directives
        <global config directives>
    
        # backend definition
        backend <typeA>
        <backend-specific directives>
    
        # first database definition & config directives
        database <typeA>
        <database-specific directives>
    
        # second database definition & config directives
        database <typeB>
        <database-specific directives>
    
        # second database definition & config directives
        database <typeA>
        <database-specific directives>
    
        # subsequent backend & database definitions & config directives
        ...

A configuration directive may take arguments. If so, they are separated by whitespace. If an argument contains whitespace, the argument should be enclosed in double quotes "like this". If an argument contains a double quote or a backslash character `\', the character should be preceded by a backslash character `\'.

The distribution contains an example configuration file that will be installed in the /usr/local/etc/openldap directory. A number of files containing schema definitions (attribute types and object classes) are also provided in the /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema directory.
6.2. Configuration File Directives

This section details commonly used configuration directives. For a complete list, see the slapd.conf(5) manual page. This section separates the configuration file directives into global, backend-specific and data-specific categories, describing each directive and its default value (if any), and giving an example of its use.
6.2.1. Global Directives

Directives described in this section apply to all backends and databases unless specifically overridden in a backend or database definition. Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets <>.
6.2.1.1. access to <what> [ by <who> [<accesslevel>] [<control>] ]+

This directive grants access (specified by <accesslevel>) to a set of entries and/or attributes (specified by <what>) by one or more requestors (specified by <who>). See the Access Control section of this guide for basic usage.

Note: If no access directives are specified, the default access control policy, access to * by * read, allows all both authenticated and anonymous users read access.

6.2.1.2. attributetype <RFC4512 Attribute Type Description>

This directive defines an attribute type. Please see the Schema Specification chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.
6.2.1.3. idletimeout <integer>

Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an idle client connection. An idletimeout of 0, the default, disables this feature.
6.2.1.4. include <filename>

This directive specifies that slapd should read additional configuration information from the given file before continuing with the next line of the current file. The included file should follow the normal slapd config file format. The file is commonly used to include files containing schema specifications.

Note: You should be careful when using this directive - there is no small limit on the number of nested include directives, and no loop detection is done.

6.2.1.5. loglevel <level>

This directive specifies the level at which debugging statements and operation statistics should be syslogged (currently logged to the syslogd(8) LOG_LOCAL4 facility). You must have configured OpenLDAP --enable-debug (the default) for this to work (except for the two statistics levels, which are always enabled). Log levels may be specified as integers or by keyword. Multiple log levels may be used and the levels are additive. To display what numbers correspond to what kind of debugging, invoke slapd with -d? or consult the table below. The possible values for <integer> are:
Table 6.1: Debugging Levels Level 	Keyword 	Description
-1 	any 	enable all debugging
0 	  	no debugging
1 	(0x1 trace) 	trace function calls
2 	(0x2 packets) 	debug packet handling
4 	(0x4 args) 	heavy trace debugging
8 	(0x8 conns) 	connection management
16 	(0x10 BER) 	print out packets sent and received
32 	(0x20 filter) 	search filter processing
64 	(0x40 config) 	configuration processing
128 	(0x80 ACL) 	access control list processing
256 	(0x100 stats) 	stats log connections/operations/results
512 	(0x200 stats2) 	stats log entries sent
1024 	(0x400 shell) 	print communication with shell backends
2048 	(0x800 parse) 	print entry parsing debugging
16384 	(0x4000 sync) 	syncrepl consumer processing
32768 	(0x8000 none) 	only messages that get logged whatever log level is set

The desired log level can be input as a single integer that combines the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal or in hexadecimal notation, as a list of integers (that are ORed internally), or as a list of the names that are shown between brackets, such that

                loglevel 129
                loglevel 0x81
                loglevel 128 1
                loglevel 0x80 0x1
                loglevel acl trace

are equivalent.

Examples:

 loglevel -1

This will cause lots and lots of debugging information to be logged.

 loglevel conns filter

Just log the connection and search filter processing.

 loglevel none

Log those messages that are logged regardless of the configured loglevel. This differs from setting the log level to 0, when no logging occurs. At least the None level is required to have high priority messages logged.

Default:

 loglevel stats

Basic stats logging is configured by default. However, if no loglevel is defined, no logging occurs (equivalent to a 0 level).
6.2.1.6. objectclass <RFC4512 Object Class Description>

This directive defines an object class. Please see the Schema Specification chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.
6.2.1.7. referral <URI>

This directive specifies the referral to pass back when slapd cannot find a local database to handle a request.

Example:

        referral ldap://root.openldap.org

This will refer non-local queries to the global root LDAP server at the OpenLDAP Project. Smart LDAP clients can re-ask their query at that server, but note that most of these clients are only going to know how to handle simple LDAP URLs that contain a host part and optionally a distinguished name part.
6.2.1.8. sizelimit <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.

Default:

        sizelimit 500

See the Limits section of this guide and slapd.conf(5) for more details.
6.2.1.9. timelimit <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will spend answering a search request. If a request is not finished in this time, a result indicating an exceeded timelimit will be returned.

Default:

        timelimit 3600

See the Limits section of this guide and slapd.conf(5) for more details.
6.2.2. General Backend Directives

Directives in this section apply only to the backend in which they are defined. They are supported by every type of backend. Backend directives apply to all databases instances of the same type and, depending on the directive, may be overridden by database directives.
6.2.2.1. backend <type>

This directive marks the beginning of a backend declaration. <type> should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 6.2.
Table 6.2: Database Backends Types 	Description
bdb 	Berkeley DB transactional backend
dnssrv 	DNS SRV backend
hdb 	Hierarchical variant of bdb backend
ldap 	Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Proxy) backend
meta 	Meta Directory backend
monitor 	Monitor backend
passwd 	Provides read-only access to passwd(5)
perl 	Perl Programmable backend
shell 	Shell (extern program) backend
sql 	SQL Programmable backend

Example:

        backend bdb

This marks the beginning of a new BDB backend definition.
6.2.3. General Database Directives

Directives in this section apply only to the database in which they are defined. They are supported by every type of database.
6.2.3.1. database <type>

This directive marks the beginning of a database instance declaration. <type> should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 6.2.

Example:

        database bdb

This marks the beginning of a new BDB database instance declaration.
6.2.3.2. limits <who> <limit> [<limit> [...]]

Specify time and size limits based on who initiated an operation.

See the Limits section of this guide and slapd.conf(5) for more details.
6.2.3.3. readonly { on | off }

This directive puts the database into "read-only" mode. Any attempts to modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.

Default:

        readonly off

6.2.3.4. rootdn <DN>

This directive specifies the DN that is not subject to access control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database. The DN need not refer to an entry in this database or even in the directory. The DN may refer to a SASL identity.

Entry-based Example:

        rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"

SASL-based Example:

        rootdn "uid=root,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth"

See the SASL Authentication section for information on SASL authentication identities.
6.2.3.5. rootpw <password>

This directive can be used to specifies a password for the DN for the rootdn (when the rootdn is set to a DN within the database).

Example:

        rootpw secret

It is also permissible to provide hash of the password in RFC2307 form. slappasswd(8) may be used to generate the password hash.

Example:

        rootpw {SSHA}ZKKuqbEKJfKSXhUbHG3fG8MDn9j1v4QN

The hash was generated using the command slappasswd -s secret.
6.2.3.6. suffix <dn suffix>

This directive specifies the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend database. Multiple suffix lines can be given, and at least one is required for each database definition.

Example:

        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

Queries with a DN ending in "dc=example,dc=com" will be passed to this backend.

Note: When the backend to pass a query to is selected, slapd looks at the suffix line(s) in each database definition in the order they appear in the file. Thus, if one database suffix is a prefix of another, it must appear after it in the config file.

6.2.3.7. syncrepl

        syncrepl rid=<replica ID>
                provider=ldap[s]://<hostname>[:port]
                [type=refreshOnly|refreshAndPersist]
                [interval=dd:hh:mm:ss]
                [retry=[<retry interval> <# of retries>]+]
                searchbase=<base DN>
                [filter=<filter str>]
                [scope=sub|one|base]
                [attrs=<attr list>]
                [attrsonly]
                [sizelimit=<limit>]
                [timelimit=<limit>]
                [schemachecking=on|off]
                [bindmethod=simple|sasl]
                [binddn=<DN>]
                [saslmech=<mech>]
                [authcid=<identity>]
                [authzid=<identity>]
                [credentials=<passwd>]
                [realm=<realm>]
                [secprops=<properties>]
                [starttls=yes|critical]
                [tls_cert=<file>]
                [tls_key=<file>]
                [tls_cacert=<file>]
                [tls_cacertdir=<path>]
                [tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
                [tls_ciphersuite=<ciphers>]
                [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]
                [logbase=<base DN>]
                [logfilter=<filter str>]
                [syncdata=default|accesslog|changelog]

This directive specifies the current database as a replica of the master content by establishing the current slapd(8) as a replication consumer site running a syncrepl replication engine. The master database is located at the replication provider site specified by the provider parameter. The replica database is kept up-to-date with the master content using the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol. See RFC4533 for more information on the protocol.

The rid parameter is used for identification of the current syncrepl directive within the replication consumer server, where <replica ID> uniquely identifies the syncrepl specification described by the current syncrepl directive. <replica ID> is non-negative and is no more than three decimal digits in length.

The provider parameter specifies the replication provider site containing the master content as an LDAP URI. The provider parameter specifies a scheme, a host and optionally a port where the provider slapd instance can be found. Either a domain name or IP address may be used for <hostname>. Examples are ldap://provider.example.com:389 or ldaps://192.168.1.1:636. If <port> is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used. Note that the syncrepl uses a consumer-initiated protocol, and hence its specification is located at the consumer site, whereas the replica specification is located at the provider site. syncrepl and replica directives define two independent replication mechanisms. They do not represent the replication peers of each other.

The content of the syncrepl replica is defined using a search specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send search requests to the provider slapd according to the search specification. The search specification includes searchbase, scope, filter, attrs, attrsonly, sizelimit, and timelimit parameters as in the normal search specification. The searchbase parameter has no default value and must always be specified. The scope defaults to sub, the filter defaults to (objectclass=*), attrs defaults to "*,+" to replicate all user and operational attributes, and attrsonly is unset by default. Both sizelimit and timelimit default to "unlimited", and only positive integers or "unlimited" may be specified.

The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types: refreshOnly and refreshAndPersist. The operation type is specified by the type parameter. In the refreshOnly operation, the next synchronization search operation is periodically rescheduled at an interval time after each synchronization operation finishes. The interval is specified by the interval parameter. It is set to one day by default. In the refreshAndPersist operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the provider slapd instance. Further updates to the master replica will generate searchResultEntry to the consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent synchronization search.

If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt to reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of the <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs. For example, retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next three times before stop retrying. + in <# of retries> means indefinite number of retries until success.

The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site by turning on the schemachecking parameter. If it is turned on, every replicated entry will be checked for its schema as the entry is stored into the replica content. Every entry in the replica should contain those attributes required by the schema definition. If it is turned off, entries will be stored without checking schema conformance. The default is off.

The binddn parameter gives the DN to bind as for the syncrepl searches to the provider slapd. It should be a DN which has read access to the replication content in the master database.

The bindmethod is simple or sasl, depending on whether simple password-based authentication or SASL authentication is to be used when connecting to the provider slapd instance.

Simple authentication should not be used unless adequate data integrity and confidentiality protections are in place (e.g. TLS or IPsec). Simple authentication requires specification of binddn and credentials parameters.

SASL authentication is generally recommended. SASL authentication requires specification of a mechanism using the saslmech parameter. Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using authcid and credentials, respectively. The authzid parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.

The realm parameter specifies a realm which a certain mechanisms authenticate the identity within. The secprops parameter specifies Cyrus SASL security properties.

The starttls parameter specifies use of the StartTLS extended operation to establish a TLS session before authenticating to the provider. If the critical argument is supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session continues without TLS. The tls_reqcert setting defaults to "demand" and the other TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings.

Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs of data modifications. This mode of operation is referred to as delta syncrepl. In addition to the above parameters, the logbase and logfilter parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will be used. The syncdata parameter must be set to either "accesslog" if the log conforms to the slapo-accesslog(5) log format, or "changelog" if the log conforms to the obsolete changelog format. If the syncdata parameter is omitted or set to "default" then the log parameters are ignored.

The syncrepl replication mechanism is supported by the bdb, hdb, and mdb backends.

See the LDAP Sync Replication chapter of this guide for more information on how to use this directive.
6.2.3.8. updateref <URL>

This directive is only applicable in a slave (or shadow) slapd(8) instance. It specifies the URL to return to clients which submit update requests upon the replica. If specified multiple times, each URL is provided.

Example:

        updateref       ldap://master.example.net

6.2.4. BDB and HDB Database Directives

Directives in this category only apply to both the BDB and the HDB database. That is, they must follow a "database bdb" or "database hdb" line and come before any subsequent "backend" or "database" line. For a complete reference of BDB/HDB configuration directives, see slapd-bdb(5).
6.2.4.1. directory <directory>

This directive specifies the directory where the BDB files containing the database and associated indices live.

Default:

        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

6.3. Configuration File Example

The following is an example configuration file, interspersed with explanatory text. It defines two databases to handle different parts of the X.500 tree; both are BDB database instances. The line numbers shown are provided for reference only and are not included in the actual file. First, the global configuration section:

  1.    # example config file - global configuration section
  2.    include /usr/local/etc/schema/core.schema
  3.    referral ldap://root.openldap.org
  4.    access to * by * read

Line 1 is a comment. Line 2 includes another config file which contains core schema definitions. The referral directive on line 3 means that queries not local to one of the databases defined below will be referred to the LDAP server running on the standard port (389) at the host root.openldap.org.

Line 4 is a global access control. It applies to all entries (after any applicable database-specific access controls).

The next section of the configuration file defines a BDB backend that will handle queries for things in the "dc=example,dc=com" portion of the tree. The database is to be replicated to two slave slapds, one on truelies, the other on judgmentday. Indices are to be maintained for several attributes, and the userPassword attribute is to be protected from unauthorized access.

  5.    # BDB definition for the example.com
  6.    database bdb
  7.    suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
  8.    directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
  9.    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 10.    rootpw secret
 11.    # indexed attribute definitions
 12.    index uid pres,eq
 13.    index cn,sn pres,eq,approx,sub
 14.    index objectClass eq
 15.    # database access control definitions
 16.    access to attrs=userPassword
 17.        by self write
 18.        by anonymous auth
 19.        by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 20.        by * none
 21.    access to *
 22.        by self write
 23.        by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 24.        by * read

Line 5 is a comment. The start of the database definition is marked by the database keyword on line 6. Line 7 specifies the DN suffix for queries to pass to this database. Line 8 specifies the directory in which the database files will live.

Lines 9 and 10 identify the database super-user entry and associated password. This entry is not subject to access control or size or time limit restrictions.

Lines 12 through 14 indicate the indices to maintain for various attributes.

Lines 16 through 24 specify access control for entries in this database. For all applicable entries, the userPassword attribute is writable by the entry itself and by the "admin" entry. It may be used for authentication/authorization purposes, but is otherwise not readable. All other attributes are writable by the entry and the "admin" entry, but may be read by all users (authenticated or not).

The next section of the example configuration file defines another BDB database. This one handles queries involving the dc=example,dc=net subtree but is managed by the same entity as the first database. Note that without line 39, the read access would be allowed due to the global access rule at line 4.

 33.    # BDB definition for example.net
 34.    database bdb
 35.    suffix "dc=example,dc=net"
 36.    directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data-net
 37.    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 38.    index objectClass eq
 39.    access to * by users read

 7. Running slapd

 slapd(8) is designed to be run as a standalone service. This allows the server to take advantage of caching, manage concurrency issues with underlying databases, and conserve system resources. Running from inetd(8) is NOT an option.
 7.1. Command-Line Options

 slapd(8) supports a number of command-line options as detailed in the manual page. This section details a few commonly used options.

         -f <filename>

 This option specifies an alternate configuration file for slapd. The default is normally /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf.

         -F <slapd-config-directory>

 Specifies the slapd configuration directory. The default is /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d.

 If both -f and -F are specified, the config file will be read and converted to config directory format and written to the specified directory. If neither option is specified, slapd will attempt to read the default config directory before trying to use the default config file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config file is ignored. All of the slap tools that use the config options observe this same behavior.

         -h <URLs>

 This option specifies alternative listener configurations. The default is ldap:/// which implies LDAP over TCP on all interfaces on the default LDAP port 389. You can specify specific host-port pairs or other protocol schemes (such as ldaps:// or ldapi://).
 URL 	Protocol 	Transport
 ldap:/// 	LDAP 	TCP port 389
 ldaps:/// 	LDAP over SSL 	TCP port 636
 ldapi:/// 	LDAP 	IPC (Unix-domain socket)

 For example, -h "ldaps:// ldap://127.0.0.1:666" will create two listeners: one for the (non-standard) ldaps:// scheme on all interfaces on the default ldaps:// port 636, and one for the standard ldap:// scheme on the localhost (loopback) interface on port 666. Hosts may be specified using using hostnames or IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Port values must be numeric.

 For LDAP over IPC, the pathname of the Unix-domain socket can be encoded in the URL. Note that directory separators must be URL-encoded, like any other characters that are special to URLs. Thus the socket /usr/local/var/ldapi must be encoded as

         ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi

 ldapi: is described in detail in Using LDAP Over IPC Mechanisms [Chu-LDAPI]

 Note that the ldapi:/// transport is not widely implemented: non-OpenLDAP clients may not be able to use it.

         -n <service-name>

 This option specifies the service name used for logging and other purposes. The default service name is slapd.

         -l <syslog-local-user>

 This option specifies the local user for the syslog(8) facility. Values can be LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, ..., and LOCAL7. The default is LOCAL4. This option may not be supported on all systems.

         -u user -g group

 These options specify the user and group, respectively, to run as. user can be either a user name or uid. group can be either a group name or gid.

         -r directory

 This option specifies a run-time directory. slapd will chroot(2) to this directory after opening listeners but before reading any configuration files or initializing any backends.

         -d <level> | ?

 This option sets the slapd debug level to <level>. When level is a `?' character, the various debugging levels are printed and slapd exits, regardless of any other options you give it. Current debugging levels are
 Table 7.1: Debugging Levels Level 	Keyword 	Description
 -1 	any 	enable all debugging
 0 	  	no debugging
 1 	(0x1 trace) 	trace function calls
 2 	(0x2 packets) 	debug packet handling
 4 	(0x4 args) 	heavy trace debugging
 8 	(0x8 conns) 	connection management
 16 	(0x10 BER) 	print out packets sent and received
 32 	(0x20 filter) 	search filter processing
 64 	(0x40 config) 	configuration processing
 128 	(0x80 ACL) 	access control list processing
 256 	(0x100 stats) 	stats log connections/operations/results
 512 	(0x200 stats2) 	stats log entries sent
 1024 	(0x400 shell) 	print communication with shell backends
 2048 	(0x800 parse) 	print entry parsing debugging
 16384 	(0x4000 sync) 	syncrepl consumer processing
 32768 	(0x8000 none) 	only messages that get logged whatever log level is set

 You may enable multiple levels by specifying the debug option once for each desired level. Or, since debugging levels are additive, you can do the math yourself. That is, if you want to trace function calls and watch the config file being processed, you could set level to the sum of those two levels (in this case, -d 65). Or, you can let slapd do the math, (e.g. -d 1 -d 64). Consult <ldap_log.h> for more details.

 Note: slapd must have been compiled with --enable-debug defined for any debugging information beyond the two stats levels to be available (the default).

 7.2. Starting slapd

 In general, slapd is run like this:

         /usr/local/libexec/slapd [<option>]*

 where /usr/local/libexec is determined by configure and <option> is one of the options described above (or in slapd(8)). Unless you have specified a debugging level (including level 0), slapd will automatically fork and detach itself from its controlling terminal and run in the background.
 7.3. Stopping slapd

 To kill off slapd(8) safely, you should give a command like this

         kill -INT `cat /usr/local/var/slapd.pid`

 where /usr/local/var is determined by configure.

 Killing slapd by a more drastic method may cause information loss or database corruption.

 8. Access Control
 8.1. Introduction

 As the directory gets populated with more and more data of varying sensitivity, controlling the kinds of access granted to the directory becomes more and more critical. For instance, the directory may contain data of a confidential nature that you may need to protect by contract or by law. Or, if using the directory to control access to other services, inappropriate access to the directory may create avenues of attack to your sites security that result in devastating damage to your assets.

 Access to your directory can be configured via two methods, the first using The slapd Configuration File and the second using the slapd-config(5) format (Configuring slapd).

 The default access control policy is allow read by all clients. Regardless of what access control policy is defined, the rootdn is always allowed full rights (i.e. auth, search, compare, read and write) on everything and anything.

 As a consequence, it's useless (and results in a performance penalty) to explicitly list the rootdn among the <by> clauses.

 The following sections will describe Access Control Lists in greater depth and follow with some examples and recommendations. See slapd.access(5) for complete details.
 8.2. Access Control via Static Configuration

 Access to entries and attributes is controlled by the access configuration file directive. The general form of an access line is:

     <access directive> ::= access to <what>
         [by <who> [<access>] [<control>] ]+
     <what> ::= * |
         [dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
         [filter=<ldapfilter>] [attrs=<attrlist>]
     <basic-style> ::= regex | exact

 where the <what> part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the <who> part specifies which entities are granted access, and the <access> part specifies the access granted. Multiple <who> <access> <control> triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these access control options are described here; for more details see the slapd.access(5) man page.
 8.2.1. What to control access to

 The <what> part of an access specification determines the entries and attributes to which the access control applies. Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter. The following qualifiers select entries by DN:

     to *
     to dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>
     to dn.<scope-style>=<DN>

 The first form is used to select all entries. The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the target entry's normalized DN. (The second form is not discussed further in this document.) The third form is used to select entries which are within the requested scope of DN. The <DN> is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in RFC4514.

 The scope can be either base, one, subtree, or children. Where base matches only the entry with provided DN, one matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, subtree matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and children matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).

 For example, if the directory contained entries named:

     0: o=suffix
     1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
     2: ou=people,o=suffix
     3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
     4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
     5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix

 Then:

     dn.base="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2;
     dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, and 5;
     dn.subtree="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and
     dn.children="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, 4, and 5.

 Entries may also be selected using a filter:

     to filter=<ldap filter>

 where <ldap filter> is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in RFC4515. For example:

     to filter=(objectClass=person)

 Note that entries may be selected by both DN and filter by including both qualifiers in the <what> clause.

     to dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" filter=(objectClass=person)

 Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the <what> selector:

     attrs=<attribute list>

 A specific value of an attribute is selected by using a single attribute name and also using a value selector:

     attrs=<attribute> val[.<style>]=<regex>

 There are two special pseudo attributes entry and children. To read (and hence return) a target entry, the subject must have read access to the target's entry attribute. To perform a search, the subject must have search access to the search base's entry attribute. To add or delete an entry, the subject must have write access to the entry's entry attribute AND must have write access to the entry's parent's children attribute. To rename an entry, the subject must have write access to entry's entry attribute AND have write access to both the old parent's and new parent's children attributes. The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.

 Lastly, there is a special entry selector "*" that is used to select any entry. It is used when no other <what> selector has been provided. It's equivalent to "dn=.*"
 8.2.2. Who to grant access to

 The <who> part identifies the entity or entities being granted access. Note that access is granted to "entities" not "entries." The following table summarizes entity specifiers:
 Table 6.3: Access Entity Specifiers Specifier 	Entities
 * 	All, including anonymous and authenticated users
	 anonymous 	Anonymous (non-authenticated) users
	 users 	Authenticated users
	 self 	User associated with target entry
	 dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> 	Users matching a regular expression
	 dn.<scope-style>=<DN> 	Users within scope of a DN

 The DN specifier behaves much like <what> clause DN specifiers.

 Other control factors are also supported. For example, a <who> can be restricted by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:

     dnattr=<dn-valued attribute name>

 The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).

 Some factors may not be appropriate in all environments (or any). For example, the domain factor relies on IP to domain name lookups. As these can easily be spoofed, the domain factor should be avoided.
 8.2.3. The access to grant

 The kind of <access> granted can be one of the following:
 Table 6.4: Access Levels Level 	Privileges 	Description
 none = 	0 	no access
 disclose = 	d 	needed for information disclosure on error
 auth = 	dx 	needed to authenticate (bind)
 compare = 	cdx 	needed to compare
 search = 	scdx 	needed to apply search filters
 read = 	rscdx 	needed to read search results
 write = 	wrscdx 	needed to modify/rename
 manage = 	mwrscdx 	needed to manage

 Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone write access to an entry also grants them read, search, compare, auth and disclose access. However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.
 8.2.4. Access Control Evaluation

 When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the <what> selectors given in the configuration file. For each entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the entry (or the global access directives if not held in any database) apply first, followed by the global access directives. However, when dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

 Within this priority, access directives are examined in the order in which they appear in the config file. Slapd stops with the first <what> selector that matches the entry and/or attribute. The corresponding access directive is the one slapd will use to evaluate access.

 Next, slapd compares the entity requesting access to the <who> selectors within the access directive selected above in the order in which they appear. It stops with the first <who> selector that matches the requester. This determines the access the entity requesting access has to the entry and/or attribute.

 Finally, slapd compares the access granted in the selected <access> clause to the access requested by the client. If it allows greater or equal access, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.

 The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should appear first in the config file. Similarly, if one <who> selector is more specific than another it should come first in the access directive. The access control examples given below should help make this clear.
 8.2.5. Access Control Examples

 The access control facility described above is quite powerful. This section shows some examples of its use for descriptive purposes.

 A simple example:

     access to * by * read

 This access directive grants read access to everyone.

     access to *
         by self write
         by anonymous auth
         by * read

 This directive allows the user to modify their entry, allows anonymous to authentication against these entries, and allows all others to read these entries. Note that only the first by <who> clause which matches applies. Hence, the anonymous users are granted auth, not read. The last clause could just as well have been "by users read".

 It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of protection in place. The following shows how security strength factors (SSF) can be used.

     access to *
         by ssf=128 self write
         by ssf=64 anonymous auth
         by ssf=64 users read

 This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security protections have of strength 128 or better have been established, allows authentication access to anonymous users, and read access when 64 or better security protections have been established. If client has not establish sufficient security protections, the implicit by * none clause would be applied.

 The following example shows the use of a style specifiers to select the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant.

     access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
          by * search
     access to dn.children="dc=com"
          by * read

 Read access is granted to entries under the dc=com subtree, except for those entries under the dc=example,dc=com subtree, to which search access is granted. No access is granted to dc=com as neither access directive matches this DN. If the order of these access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be reached, since all entries under dc=example,dc=com are also under dc=com entries.

 Also note that if no access to directive matches or no by <who> clause, access is denied. That is, every access to directive ends with an implicit by * none clause. When dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

 The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the by <who> clauses. It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various <who> selectors.

     access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=homePhone
         by self write
         by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
         by peername.regex=IP:10\..+ read
     access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
         by self write
         by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
         by anonymous auth

 This example applies to entries in the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree. To all attributes except homePhone, an entry can write to itself, entries under example.com entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit by * none) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously). The homePhone attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under example.com, readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable (implicit by * none). All other access is denied by the implicit access to * by * none.

 Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like this:

     access to attrs=member,entry
          by dnattr=member selfwrite

 The dnattr <who> selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the member attribute. The selfwrite access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access any of the entry's attributes.
 8.3. Access Control via Dynamic Configuration

 Access to slapd entries and attributes is controlled by the olcAccess attribute, whose values are a sequence of access directives. The general form of the olcAccess configuration is:

     olcAccess: <access directive>
     <access directive> ::= to <what>
         [by <who> [<access>] [<control>] ]+
     <what> ::= * |
         [dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
         [filter=<ldapfilter>] [attrs=<attrlist>]
     <basic-style> ::= regex | exact
     <scope-style> ::= base | one | subtree | children
     <attrlist> ::= <attr> [val[.<basic-style>]=<regex>] | <attr> , <attrlist>
     <attr> ::= <attrname> | entry | children
     <who> ::= * | [anonymous | users | self
             | dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
         [dnattr=<attrname>]
         [group[/<objectclass>[/<attrname>][.<basic-style>]]=<regex>]
         [peername[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
         [sockname[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
         [domain[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
         [sockurl[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
         [set=<setspec>]
         [aci=<attrname>]
     <access> ::= [self]{<level>|<priv>}
     <level> ::= none | disclose | auth | compare | search | read | write | manage
     <priv> ::= {=|+|-}{m|w|r|s|c|x|d|0}+
     <control> ::= [stop | continue | break]

 where the <what> part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the <who> part specifies which entities are granted access, and the <access> part specifies the access granted. Multiple <who> <access> <control> triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these access control options are described here; for more details see the slapd.access(5) man page.
 8.3.1. What to control access to

 The <what> part of an access specification determines the entries and attributes to which the access control applies. Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter. The following qualifiers select entries by DN:

     to *
     to dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>
     to dn.<scope-style>=<DN>

 The first form is used to select all entries. The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the target entry's normalized DN. (The second form is not discussed further in this document.) The third form is used to select entries which are within the requested scope of DN. The <DN> is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in RFC4514.

 The scope can be either base, one, subtree, or children. Where base matches only the entry with provided DN, one matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, subtree matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and children matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).

 For example, if the directory contained entries named:

     1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
     2: ou=people,o=suffix
     3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
     4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
     5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix

 Then:

     dn.base="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2;
     dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, and 5;
     dn.subtree="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and
     dn.children="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, 4, and 5.

 Entries may also be selected using a filter:

     to filter=<ldap filter>

 where <ldap filter> is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in RFC4515. For example:

     to filter=(objectClass=person)

 Note that entries may be selected by both DN and filter by including both qualifiers in the <what> clause.

     to dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" filter=(objectClass=person)

 Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the <what> selector:

     attrs=<attribute list>

 A specific value of an attribute is selected by using a single attribute name and also using a value selector:

     attrs=<attribute> val[.<style>]=<regex>

 8.3.2. Who to grant access to

 The <who> part identifies the entity or entities being granted access. Note that access is granted to "entities" not "entries." The following table summarizes entity specifiers:
 Table 5.3: Access Entity Specifiers Specifier 	Entities
 * 	All, including anonymous and authenticated users
	 anonymous 	Anonymous (non-authenticated) users
	 users 	Authenticated users
	 self 	User associated with target entry
	 dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> 	Users matching a regular expression
	 dn.<scope-style>=<DN> 	Users within scope of a DN

 The DN specifier behaves much like <what> clause DN specifiers.

 Other control factors are also supported. For example, a <who> can be restricted by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:

     dnattr=<dn-valued attribute name>

 The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).

 Some factors may not be appropriate in all environments (or any). For example, the domain factor relies on IP to domain name lookups. As these can easily be spoofed, the domain factor should be avoided.
 8.3.3. The access to grant

 The kind of <access> granted can be one of the following:
 Table 5.4: Access Levels Level 	Privileges 	Description
 none 	=0 	no access
 disclose 	=d 	needed for information disclosure on error
 auth 	=dx 	needed to authenticate (bind)
 compare 	=cdx 	needed to compare
 search 	=scdx 	needed to apply search filters
 read 	=rscdx 	needed to read search results
 write 	=wrscdx 	needed to modify/rename
 manage 	=mwrscdx 	needed to manage

 Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone write access to an entry also grants them read, search, compare, auth and disclose access. However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.
 8.3.4. Access Control Evaluation

 When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the <what> selectors given in the configuration. For each entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the entry (or the global access directives if not held in any database) apply first, followed by the global access directives (which are held in the frontend database definition). However, when dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

 The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should appear first in the configuration. Similarly, if one <who> selector is more specific than another it should come first in the access directive. The access control examples given below should help make this clear.
 8.3.5. Access Control Examples

 The access control facility described above is quite powerful. This section shows some examples of its use for descriptive purposes.

 A simple example:

     olcAccess: to * by * read

 This access directive grants read access to everyone.

     olcAccess: to *
         by self write
         by anonymous auth
         by * read

 This directive allows the user to modify their entry, allows anonymous to authenticate against these entries, and allows all others to read these entries. Note that only the first by <who> clause which matches applies. Hence, the anonymous users are granted auth, not read. The last clause could just as well have been "by users read".

 It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of protection in place. The following shows how security strength factors (SSF) can be used.

     olcAccess: to *
         by ssf=128 self write
         by ssf=64 anonymous auth
         by ssf=64 users read

 This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security protections of strength 128 or better have been established, allows authentication access to anonymous users, and read access when strength 64 or better security protections have been established. If the client has not establish sufficient security protections, the implicit by * none clause would be applied.

 The following example shows the use of style specifiers to select the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant.

     olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
          by * search
     olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=com"
          by * read

 Read access is granted to entries under the dc=com subtree, except for those entries under the dc=example,dc=com subtree, to which search access is granted. No access is granted to dc=com as neither access directive matches this DN. If the order of these access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be reached, since all entries under dc=example,dc=com are also under dc=com entries.

 Also note that if no olcAccess: to directive matches or no by <who> clause, access is denied. When dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

 The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the by <who> clauses. It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various <who> selectors.

     olcAccess: to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=homePhone
         by self write
         by dn.children=dc=example,dc=com" search
         by peername.regex=IP:10\..+ read
     olcAccess: to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
         by self write
         by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
         by anonymous auth

 This example applies to entries in the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree. To all attributes except homePhone, an entry can write to itself, entries under example.com entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit by * none) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously). The homePhone attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under example.com, readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable (implicit by * none). All other access is denied by the implicit access to * by * none.

 Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like this:

     olcAccess: to attrs=member,entry
          by dnattr=member selfwrite

 The dnattr <who> selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the member attribute. The selfwrite access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access any of the entry's attributes.
 8.3.6. Access Control Ordering

 Since the ordering of olcAccess directives is essential to their proper evaluation, but LDAP attributes normally do not preserve the ordering of their values, OpenLDAP uses a custom schema extension to maintain a fixed ordering of these values. This ordering is maintained by prepending a "{X}" numeric index to each value, similarly to the approach used for ordering the configuration entries. These index tags are maintained automatically by slapd and do not need to be specified when originally defining the values. For example, when you create the settings

     olcAccess: to attrs=member,entry
          by dnattr=member selfwrite
     olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
          by * search
     olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=com"
          by * read

 when you read them back using slapcat or ldapsearch they will contain

     olcAccess: {0}to attrs=member,entry
          by dnattr=member selfwrite
     olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
          by * search
     olcAccess: {2}to dn.children="dc=com"
          by * read

 The numeric index may be used to specify a particular value to change when using ldapmodify to edit the access rules. This index can be used instead of (or in addition to) the actual access value. Using this numeric index is very helpful when multiple access rules are being managed.

 For example, if we needed to change the second rule above to grant write access instead of search, we could try this LDIF:

     changetype: modify
     delete: olcAccess
     olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * search
     -
     add: olcAccess
     olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * write
     -

 But this example will not guarantee that the existing values remain in their original order, so it will most likely yield a broken security configuration. Instead, the numeric index should be used:

     changetype: modify
     delete: olcAccess
     olcAccess: {1}
     -
     add: olcAccess
     olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * write
     -

 This example deletes whatever rule is in value #1 of the olcAccess attribute (regardless of its value) and adds a new value that is explicitly inserted as value #1. The result will be

     olcAccess: {0}to attrs=member,entry
          by dnattr=member selfwrite
     olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
          by * write
     olcAccess: {2}to dn.children="dc=com"
          by * read

 which is exactly what was intended.
 8.4. Access Control Common Examples
 8.4.1. Basic ACLs

 Generally one should start with some basic ACLs such as:

     access to attr=userPassword
         by self =xw
         by anonymous auth
         by * none


       access to *
         by self write
         by users read
         by * none

 The first ACL allows users to update (but not read) their passwords, anonymous users to authenticate against this attribute, and (implicitly) denying all access to others.

 The second ACL allows users full access to their entry, authenticated users read access to anything, and (implicitly) denying all access to others (in this case, anonymous users).
 8.4.2. Matching Anonymous and Authenticated users

 An anonymous user has a empty DN. While the dn.exact="" or dn.regex="^$" could be used, slapd(8)) offers an anonymous shorthand which should be used instead.

     access to *
       by anonymous none
       by * read

 denies all access to anonymous users while granting others read.

 Authenticated users have a subject DN. While dn.regex=".+" will match any authenticated user, OpenLDAP provides the users short hand which should be used instead.

     access to *
       by users read
       by * none

 This ACL grants read permissions to authenticated users while denying others (i.e.: anonymous users).
 8.4.3. Controlling rootdn access

 You could specify the rootdn in slapd.conf(5) or slapd.d without specifying a rootpw. Then you have to add an actual directory entry with the same dn, e.g.:

     dn: cn=Manager,o=MyOrganization
     cn: Manager
     sn: Manager
     objectClass: person
     objectClass: top
     userPassword: {SSHA}someSSHAdata

 Then binding as the rootdn will require a regular bind to that DN, which in turn requires auth access to that entry's DN and userPassword, and this can be restricted via ACLs. E.g.:

     access to dn.base="cn=Manager,o=MyOrganization"
       by peername.regex=127\.0\.0\.1 auth
       by peername.regex=192\.168\.0\..* auth
       by users none
       by * none

 The ACLs above will only allow binding using rootdn from localhost and 192.168.0.0/24.
 8.4.4. Managing access with Groups

 There are a few ways to do this. One approach is illustrated here. Consider the following DIT layout:

     +-dc=example,dc=com
     +---cn=administrators,dc=example,dc=com
     +---cn=fred blogs,dc=example,dc=com

 and the following group object (in LDIF format):

     dn: cn=administrators,dc=example,dc=com
     cn: administrators of this region
     objectclass: groupOfNames  (important for the group acl feature)
     member: cn=fred blogs,dc=example,dc=com
     member: cn=somebody else,dc=example,dc=com

 One can then grant access to the members of this this group by adding appropriate by group clause to an access directive in slapd.conf(5). For instance,

     access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by self write
         by group.exact="cn=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" write
         by * auth

 Like by dn clauses, one can also use expand to expand the group name based upon the regular expression matching of the target, that is, the to dn.regex). For instance,

     access to dn.regex="(.+,)?ou=People,(dc=[^,]+,dc=[^,]+)$"
              attrs=children,entry,uid
         by group.expand="cn=Managers,$2" write
         by users read
         by * auth

 The above illustration assumed that the group members are to be found in the member attribute type of the groupOfNames object class. If you need to use a different group object and/or a different attribute type then use the following slapd.conf(5) (abbreviated) syntax:

     access to <what>
             by group/<objectclass>/<attributename>=<DN> <access>

 For example:

     access to *
       by group/organizationalRole/roleOccupant="cn=Administrator,dc=example,dc=com" write

 In this case, we have an ObjectClass organizationalRole which contains the administrator DN's in the roleOccupant attribute. For instance:

     dn: cn=Administrator,dc=example,dc=com
     cn: Administrator
     objectclass: organizationalRole
     roleOccupant: cn=Jane Doe,dc=example,dc=com

 Note: the specified member attribute type MUST be of DN or NameAndOptionalUID syntax, and the specified object class SHOULD allow the attribute type.

 Dynamic Groups are also supported in Access Control. Please see slapo-dynlist(5) and the Dynamic Lists overlay section.
 8.4.5. Granting access to a subset of attributes

 You can grant access to a set of attributes by specifying a list of attribute names in the ACL to clause. To be useful, you also need to grant access to the entry itself. Also note how children controls the ability to add, delete, and rename entries.

     # mail: self may write, authenticated users may read
     access to attrs=mail
       by self write
       by users read
       by * none
    
     # cn, sn: self my write, all may read
     access to attrs=cn,sn
       by self write
       by * read
    
     # immediate children: only self can add/delete entries under this entry
     access to attrs=children
       by self write
    
     # entry itself: self may write, all may read
     access to attrs=entry
       by self write
       by * read
    
     # other attributes: self may write, others have no access
     access to *
       by self write
       by * none

 ObjectClass names may also be specified in this list, which will affect all the attributes that are required and/or allowed by that objectClass. Actually, names in attrlist that are prefixed by @ are directly treated as objectClass names. A name prefixed by ! is also treated as an objectClass, but in this case the access rule affects the attributes that are not required nor allowed by that objectClass.
 8.4.6. Allowing a user write to all entries below theirs

 For a setup where a user can write to its own record and to all of its children:

     access to dn.regex="(.+,)?(uid=[^,]+,o=Company)$"
        by dn.exact,expand="$2" write
        by anonymous auth

 (Add more examples for above)
 8.4.7. Allowing entry creation

 Let's say, you have it like this:

         o=<basedn>
             ou=domains
                 associatedDomain=<somedomain>
                     ou=users
                         uid=<someuserid>
                         uid=<someotheruserid>
                     ou=addressbooks
                         uid=<someuserid>
                             cn=<someone>
                             cn=<someoneelse>

 and, for another domain <someotherdomain>:

         o=<basedn>
             ou=domains
                 associatedDomain=<someotherdomain>
                     ou=users
                         uid=<someuserid>
                         uid=<someotheruserid>
                     ou=addressbooks
                         uid=<someotheruserid>
                             cn=<someone>
                             cn=<someoneelse>

 then, if you wanted user uid=<someuserid> to ONLY create an entry for its own thing, you could write an ACL like this:

     # this rule lets users of "associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>"
     # write under "ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>,ou=domains,o=<basedn>",
     # i.e. a user can write ANY entry below its domain's address book;
     # this permission is necessary, but not sufficient, the next
     # will restrict this permission further


     access to dn.regex="^ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=([^,]+),ou=domains,o=<basedn>$" attrs=children
             by dn.regex="^uid=([^,]+),ou=users,associatedDomain=$1,ou=domains,o=<basedn>$$" write
             by * none


     # Note that above the "by" clause needs a "regex" style to make sure
     # it expands to a DN that starts with a "uid=<someuserid>" pattern
     # while substituting the associatedDomain submatch from the "what" clause.


     # This rule lets a user with "uid=<matcheduid>" of "<associatedDomain=matcheddomain>"
     # write (i.e. add, modify, delete) the entry whose DN is exactly
     # "uid=<matcheduid>,ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>,ou=domains,o=<basedn>"
     # and ANY entry as subtree of it


     access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=([^,]+),ou=domains,o=<basedn>$"
             by dn.exact,expand="uid=$2,ou=users,associatedDomain=$3,ou=domains,o=<basedn>" write
             by * none


     # Note that above the "by" clause uses the "exact" style with the "expand"
     # modifier because now the whole pattern can be rebuilt by means of the
     # submatches from the "what" clause, so a "regex" compilation and evaluation
     # is no longer required.

 8.4.8. Tips for using regular expressions in Access Control

 Always use dn.regex=<pattern> when you intend to use regular expression matching. dn=<pattern> alone defaults to dn.exact<pattern>.

 Use (.+) instead of (.*) when you want at least one char to be matched. (.*) matches the empty string as well.

 Don't use regular expressions for matches that can be done otherwise in a safer and cheaper manner. Examples:

     dn.regex=".*dc=example,dc=com"

 is unsafe and expensive:

     unsafe because any string containing dc=example,dc=com will match, not only those that end with the desired pattern; use .*dc=example,dc=com$ instead.
     unsafe also because it would allow any attributeType ending with dc as naming attribute for the first RDN in the string, e.g. a custom attributeType mydc would match as well. If you really need a regular expression that allows just dc=example,dc=com or any of its subtrees, use ^(.+,)?dc=example,dc=com$, which means: anything to the left of dc=..., if any (the question mark after the pattern within brackets), must end with a comma;
     expensive because if you don't need submatches, you could use scoping styles, e.g.
    
     dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"

 to include dc=example,dc=com in the matching patterns,

     dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"

 to exclude dc=example,dc=com from the matching patterns, or

     dn.onelevel="dc=example,dc=com"

 to allow exactly one sublevel matches only.

 Always use ^ and $ in regexes, whenever appropriate, because ou=(.+),ou=(.+),ou=addressbooks,o=basedn will match something=bla,ou=xxx,ou=yyy,ou=addressbooks,o=basedn,ou=addressbooks,o=basedn,dc=some,dc=org

 Always use ([^,]+) to indicate exactly one RDN, because (.+) can include any number of RDNs; e.g. ou=(.+),dc=example,dc=com will match ou=My,o=Org,dc=example,dc=com, which might not be what you want.

 Never add the rootdn to the by clauses. ACLs are not even processed for operations performed with rootdn identity (otherwise there would be no reason to define a rootdn at all).

 Use shorthands. The user directive matches authenticated users and the anonymous directive matches anonymous users.

 Don't use the dn.regex form for <by> clauses if all you need is scoping and/or substring replacement; use scoping styles (e.g. exact, onelevel, children or subtree) and the style modifier expand to cause substring expansion.

 For instance,

     access to dn.regex=".+,dc=([^,]+),dc=([^,]+)$"
       by dn.regex="^[^,],ou=Admin,dc=$1,dc=$2$$" write

 although correct, can be safely and efficiently replaced by

     access to dn.regex=".+,(dc=[^,]+,dc=[^,]+)$"
       by dn.onelevel,expand="ou=Admin,$1" write

 where the regex in the <what> clause is more compact, and the one in the <by> clause is replaced by a much more efficient scoping style of onelevel with substring expansion.
 8.4.9. Granting and Denying access based on security strength factors (ssf)

 You can restrict access based on the security strength factor (SSF)

     access to dn="cn=example,cn=edu"
           by * ssf=256 read

 0 (zero) implies no protection, 1 implies integrity protection only, 56 DES or other weak ciphers, 112 triple DES and other strong ciphers, 128 RC4, Blowfish and other modern strong ciphers.

 Other possibilities:

     transport_ssf=<n>
     tls_ssf=<n>
     sasl_ssf=<n>

 256 is recommended.

 See slapd.conf(5) for information on ssf.
 8.4.10. When things aren't working as expected

 Consider this example:

     access to *
       by anonymous auth
    
     access to *
       by self write
    
     access to *
       by users read

 You may think this will allow any user to login, to read everything and change his own data if he is logged in. But in this example only the login works and an ldapsearch returns no data. The Problem is that SLAPD goes through its access config line by line and stops as soon as it finds a match in the part of the access rule.(here: to *)

 To get what we wanted the file has to read:

     access to *
       by anonymous auth
       by self write
       by users read

 The general rule is: "special access rules first, generic access rules last"

 See also slapd.access(5), loglevel 128 and slapacl(8) for debugging information.
 8.5. Sets - Granting rights based on relationships

 Sets are best illustrated via examples. The following sections will present a few set ACL examples in order to facilitate their understanding.

 (Sets in Access Controls FAQ Entry: http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1133.html)

 Note: Sets are considered experimental.

 8.5.1. Groups of Groups

 The OpenLDAP ACL for groups doesn't expand groups within groups, which are groups that have another group as a member. For example:

  dn: cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
  cn: sudoadm
  objectClass: groupOfNames
  member: uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
  member: cn=accountadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com

  dn: cn=accountadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
  cn: accountadm
  objectClass: groupOfNames
  member: uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

 If we use standard group ACLs with the above entries and allow members of the sudoadm group to write somewhere, mary won't be included:

  access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
          by group.exact="cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com" write
          by * read

 With sets we can make the ACL be recursive and consider group within groups. So for each member that is a group, it is further expanded:

  access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
        by set="[cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/member* & user" write
        by * read

 This set ACL means: take the cn=sudoadm DN, check its member attribute(s) (where the "*" means recursively) and intersect the result with the authenticated user's DN. If the result is non-empty, the ACL is considered a match and write access is granted.

 The following drawing explains how this set is built:

 Figure X.Y: Populating a recursive group set

 First we get the uid=john DN. This entry doesn't have a member attribute, so the expansion stops here. Now we get to cn=accountadm. This one does have a member attribute, which is uid=mary. The uid=mary entry, however, doesn't have member, so we stop here again. The end comparison is:

  {"uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com","uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"} & user

 If the authenticated user's DN is any one of those two, write access is granted. So this set will include mary in the sudoadm group and she will be allowed the write access.
 8.5.2. Group ACLs without DN syntax

 The traditional group ACLs, and even the previous example about recursive groups, require that the members are specified as DNs instead of just usernames.

 With sets, however, it's also possible to use simple names in group ACLs, as this example will show.

 Let's say we want to allow members of the sudoadm group to write to the ou=suders branch of our tree. But our group definition now is using memberUid for the group members:

  dn: cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
  cn: sudoadm
  objectClass: posixGroup
  gidNumber: 1000
  memberUid: john

 With this type of group, we can't use group ACLs. But with a set ACL we can grant the desired access:

  access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
        by set="[cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/memberUid & user/uid" write
        by * read

 We use a simple intersection where we compare the uid attribute of the connecting (and authenticated) user with the memberUid attributes of the group. If they match, the intersection is non-empty and the ACL will grant write access.

 This drawing illustrates this set when the connecting user is authenticated as uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com:

 Figure X.Y: Sets with memberUid

 In this case, it's a match. If it were mary authenticating, however, she would be denied write access to ou=sudoers because her uid attribute is not listed in the group's memberUid.
 8.5.3. Following references

 We will now show a quite powerful example of what can be done with sets. This example tends to make OpenLDAP administrators smile after they have understood it and its implications.

 Let's start with an user entry:

  dn: uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
  uid: john
  objectClass: inetOrgPerson
  givenName: John
  sn: Smith
  cn: john
  manager: uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

 Writing an ACL to allow the manager to update some attributes is quite simple using sets:

  access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
     attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
     by self write
     by set="this/manager & user" write
     by * read

 In that set, this expands to the entry being accessed, so that this/manager expands to uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com when john's entry is accessed. If the manager herself is accessing John's entry, the ACL will match and write access to those attributes will be granted.

 So far, this same behavior can be obtained with the dnattr keyword. With sets, however, we can further enhance this ACL. Let's say we want to allow the secretary of the manager to also update these attributes. This is how we do it:

  access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
     attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
     by self write
     by set="this/manager & user" write
     by set="this/manager/secretary & user" write
     by * read

 Now we need a picture to help explain what is happening here (entries shortened for clarity):

 Figure X.Y: Sets jumping through entries

 In this example, Jane is the secretary of Mary, which is the manager of John. This whole relationship is defined with the manager and secretary attributes, which are both of the distinguishedName syntax (i.e., full DNs). So, when the uid=john entry is being accessed, the this/manager/secretary set becomes {"uid=jane,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"} (follow the references in the picture):

  this = [uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]
  this/manager = \
    [uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]/manager = uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
  this/manager/secretary = \
    [uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]/secretary = uid=jane,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

 The end result is that when Jane accesses John's entry, she will be granted write access to the specified attributes. Better yet, this will happen to any entry she accesses which has Mary as the manager.

 This is all cool and nice, but perhaps gives too much power to secretaries. Maybe we need to further restrict it. For example, let's only allow executive secretaries to have this power:

  access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
    by self write
    by set="this/manager & user" write
    by set="this/manager/secretary &
            [cn=executive,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/member* &
            user" write
    by * read

 It's almost the same ACL as before, but we now also require that the connecting user be a member of the (possibly nested) cn=executive group.

 9. Limits
 9.1. Introduction

 It is usually desirable to limit the server resources that can be consumed by each LDAP client. OpenLDAP provides two sets of limits: a size limit, which can restrict the number of entries that a client can retrieve in a single operation, and a time limit which restricts the length of time that an operation may continue. Both types of limit can be given different values depending on who initiated the operation.
 9.2. Soft and Hard limits

 The server administrator can specify both soft limits and hard limits. Soft limits can be thought of as being the default limit value. Hard limits cannot be exceeded by ordinary LDAP users.

 LDAP clients can specify their own size and time limits when issuing search operations. This feature has been present since the earliest version of X.500.

 If the client specifies a limit then the lower of the requested value and the hard limit will become the limit for the operation.

 If the client does not specify a limit then the server applies the soft limit.

 Soft and Hard limits are often referred to together as administrative limits. Thus, if an LDAP client requests a search that would return more results than the limits allow it will get an adminLimitExceeded error. Note that the server will usually return some results even if the limit has been exceeded: this feature is useful to clients that just want to check for the existence of some entries without needing to see them all.

 The rootdn is not subject to any limits.
 9.3. Global Limits

 Limits specified in the global part of the server configuration act as defaults which are used if no database has more specific limits set.

 In a slapd.conf(5) configuration the keywords are sizelimit and timelimit. When using the slapd config backend, the corresponding attributes are olcSizeLimit and olcTimeLimit. The syntax of these values are the same in both cases.

 The simple form sets both soft and hard limits to the same value:

    sizelimit {<integer>|unlimited}
    timelimit {<integer>|unlimited}

 The default sizelimit is 500 entries and the default timelimit is 3600 seconds.

 An extended form allows soft and hard limits to be set separately:

    sizelimit size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer> [...]
    timelimit time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]

 Thus, to set a soft sizelimit of 10 entries and a hard limit of 75 entries:

   sizelimit size.soft=10 size.hard=75

 The unchecked keyword sets a limit on how many entries the server will examine once it has created an initial set of candidate results by using indices. This can be very important in a large directory, as a search that cannot be satisfied from an index might cause the server to examine millions of entries, therefore always make sure the correct indexes are configured.
 9.4. Per-Database Limits

 Each database can have its own set of limits that override the global ones. The syntax is more flexible, and it allows different limits to be applied to different entities. Note that an entity is different from an entry: the term entity is used here to indicate the ID of the person or process that has initiated the LDAP operation.

 In a slapd.conf(5) configuration the keyword is limits. When using the slapd config backend, the corresponding attribute is olcLimits. The syntax of the values is the same in both cases.

    limits <who> <limit> [<limit> [...]]

 The limits clause can be specified multiple times to apply different limits to different initiators. The server examines each clause in turn until it finds one that matches the ID that requested the operation. If no match is found, the global limits will be used.
 9.4.1. Specify who the limits apply to

 The <who> part of the limits clause can take any of these values:
 Table ZZZ.ZZZ: Entity Specifiers Specifier 	Entities
 * 	All, including anonymous and authenticated users
	 anonymous 	Anonymous (non-authenticated) users
	 users 	Authenticated users
	 self 	User associated with target entry
	 dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> 	Users matching a regular expression
	 dn.<scope-style>=<DN> 	Users within scope of a DN
	 group[/oc[/at]]=<pattern> 	Members of a group

 The rules for specifying <who> are the same as those used in access-control rules.
 9.4.2. Specify time limits

 The syntax for time limits is

    time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer>

 where integer is the number of seconds slapd will spend answering a search request.

 If neither soft nor hard is specified, the value is used for both, e.g.:

    limits anonymous time=27

 The value unlimited may be used to remove the hard time limit entirely, e.g.:

    limits dn.exact="cn=anyuser,dc=example,dc=org" time.hard=unlimited

 9.4.3. Specifying size limits

 The syntax for size limit is

    size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer>

 where <integer> is the maximum number of entries slapd will return when answering a search request.

 Soft, hard, and "unchecked" limits are available, with the same meanings described for the global limits configuration above.
 9.4.4. Size limits and Paged Results

 If the LDAP client adds the pagedResultsControl to the search operation, the hard size limit is used by default, because the request for a specific page size is considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number of entries to be returned. However, the size limit applies to the total count of entries returned within the search, and not to a single page.

 Additional size limits may be enforced for paged searches.

 The size.pr limit controls the maximum page size:

    size.pr={<integer>|noEstimate|unlimited}

 <integer> is the maximum page size if no explicit size is set. noEstimate has no effect in the current implementation as the server does not return an estimate of the result size anyway. unlimited indicates that no limit is applied to the maximum page size.

 The size.prtotal limit controls the total number of entries that can be returned by a paged search. By default the limit is the same as the normal size.hard limit.

    size.prtotal={<integer>|unlimited|disabled}

 unlimited removes the limit on the number of entries that can be returned by a paged search. disabled can be used to selectively disable paged result searches.
 9.5. Example Limit Configurations
 9.5.1. Simple Global Limits

 This simple global configuration fragment applies size and time limits to all searches by all users except rootdn. It limits searches to 50 results and sets an overall time limit of 10 seconds.

    sizelimit 50
    timelimit 10

 9.5.2. Global Hard and Soft Limits

 It is sometimes useful to limit the size of result sets but to allow clients to request a higher limit where needed. This can be achieved by setting separate hard and soft limits.

    sizelimit size.soft=5 size.hard=100

 To prevent clients from doing very inefficient non-indexed searches, add the unchecked limit:

    sizelimit size.soft=5 size.hard=100 size.unchecked=100

 9.5.3. Giving specific users larger limits

 Having set appropriate default limits in the global configuration, you may want to give certain users the ability to retrieve larger result sets. Here is a way to do that in the per-database configuration:

    limits dn.exact="cn=anyuser,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
    limits dn.exact="cn=personnel,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
    limits dn.exact="cn=dirsync,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000

 It is generally best to avoid mentioning specific users in the server configuration. A better way is to give the higher limits to a group:

    limits group/groupOfNames/member="cn=bigwigs,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000

 9.5.4. Limiting who can do paged searches

 It may be required that certain applications need very large result sets that they retrieve using paged searches, but that you do not want ordinary LDAP users to use the pagedResults control. The pr and prtotal limits can help:

    limits group/groupOfNames/member="cn=dirsync,dc=example,dc=org" size.prtotal=unlimited
    limits users size.soft=5 size.hard=100 size.prtotal=disabled
    limits anonymous size.soft=2 size.hard=5 size.prtotal=disabled

 10. Database Creation and Maintenance Tools

 This section tells you how to create a slapd database from scratch, and how to do trouble shooting if you run into problems. There are two ways to create a database. First, you can create the database on-line using LDAP. With this method, you simply start up slapd and add entries using the LDAP client of your choice. This method is fine for relatively small databases (a few hundred or thousand entries, depending on your requirements). This method works for database types which support updates.

 The second method of database creation is to do it off-line using special utilities provided with slapd(8). This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an unacceptably long time using the LDAP method, or if you want to ensure the database is not accessed while it is being created. Note that not all database types support these utilities.
 10.1. Creating a database over LDAP

 With this method, you use the LDAP client of your choice (e.g., the ldapadd(1)) to add entries, just like you would once the database is created. You should be sure to set the following options in the configuration file before starting slapd(8).

         suffix <dn>

 As described in the General Database Directives section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you are trying to create. For example:

         suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

 You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:

         directory <directory>

 For example:

         directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

 You need to create this directory with appropriate permissions such that slapd can write to it.

 You need to configure slapd so that you can connect to it as a directory user with permission to add entries. You can configure the directory to support a special super-user or root user just for this purpose. This is done through the following two options in the database definition:

         rootdn <dn>
         rootpw <passwd>

 For example:

         rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
         rootpw secret

 These options specify a DN and password that can be used to authenticate as the super-user entry of the database (i.e., the entry allowed to do anything). The DN and password specified here will always work, regardless of whether the entry named actually exists or has the password given. This solves the chicken-and-egg problem of how to authenticate and add entries before any entries yet exist.

 Finally, you should make sure that the database definition contains the index definitions you want:

         index {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

 For example, to index the cn, sn, uid and objectclass attributes, the following index directives could be used:

         index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
         index objectClass eq

 This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the cn, sn, and uid attributes and an equality index for the objectClass attribute. Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types. See The slapd Configuration File section for more information on this option.

 Once you have configured things to your liking, start up slapd, connect with your LDAP client, and start adding entries. For example, to add an organization entry and an organizational role entry using the ldapadd tool, you could create an LDIF file called entries.ldif with the contents:

         # Organization for Example Corporation
         dn: dc=example,dc=com
         objectClass: dcObject
         objectClass: organization
         dc: example
         o: Example Corporation
         description: The Example Corporation
    
         # Organizational Role for Directory Manager
         dn: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
         objectClass: organizationalRole
         cn: Manager
         description: Directory Manager

 and then use a command like this to actually create the entry:

         ldapadd -f entries.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret

 The above command assumes settings provided in the above examples.
 10.2. Creating a database off-line

 The second method of database creation is to do it off-line, using the slapd database tools described below. This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an unacceptably long time to add using the LDAP method described above. These tools read the slapd configuration file and an input file containing a text representation of the entries to add. For database types which support the tools, they produce the database files directly (otherwise you must use the on-line method above). There are several important configuration options you will want to be sure and set in the config file database definition first:

         suffix <dn>

 As described in the General Database Directives section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you are trying to create. For example:

         suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

 You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:

         directory <directory>

 For example:

         directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

 Finally, you need to specify which indices you want to build. This is done by one or more index options.

         index {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

 For example:

         index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
         index objectClass eq

 This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the cn, sn, and uid attributes and an equality index for the objectClass attribute. Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types. See The slapd Configuration File section for more information on this option.
 10.2.1. The slapadd program

 Once you've configured things to your liking, you create the primary database and associated indices by running the slapadd(8) program:

         slapadd -l <inputfile> -f <slapdconfigfile>
                 [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <integer>|-b <suffix>]

 The arguments have the following meanings:

         -l <inputfile>

 Specifies the LDIF input file containing the entries to add in text form (described below in the The LDIF text entry format section).

         -f <slapdconfigfile>

 Specifies the slapd configuration file that tells where to create the indices, what indices to create, etc.

         -F <slapdconfdirectory>

 Specifies a config directory. If both -f and -F are specified, the config file will be read and converted to config directory format and written to the specified directory. If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config file is ignored. If dryrun mode is also specified, no conversion will occur.

         -d <debuglevel>

 Turn on debugging, as specified by <debuglevel>. The debug levels are the same as for slapd. See the Command-Line Options section in Running slapd.

         -n <databasenumber>

 An optional argument that specifies which database to modify. The first database listed in the configuration file is 1, the second 2, etc. By default, the first database in the configuration file is used. Should not be used in conjunction with -b.

         -b <suffix>

 An optional argument that specifies which database to modify. The provided suffix is matched against a database suffix directive to determine the database number. Should not be used in conjunction with -n.
 10.2.2. The slapindex program

 Sometimes it may be necessary to regenerate indices (such as after modifying slapd.conf(5)). This is possible using the slapindex(8) program. slapindex is invoked like this

         slapindex -f <slapdconfigfile>
                 [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <databasenumber>|-b <suffix>]

 Where the -f, -d, -n and -b options are the same as for the slapadd(1) program. slapindex rebuilds all indices based upon the current database contents.
 10.2.3. The slapcat program

 The slapcat program is used to dump the database to an LDIF file. This can be useful when you want to make a human-readable backup of your database or when you want to edit your database off-line. The program is invoked like this:

         slapcat -l <filename> -f <slapdconfigfile>
                 [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <databasenumber>|-b <suffix>]

 where -n or -b is used to select the database in the slapd.conf(5) specified using -f. The corresponding LDIF output is written to standard output or to the file specified using the -l option.
 10.3. The LDIF text entry format

 The LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is used to represent LDAP entries in a simple text format. This section provides a brief description of the LDIF entry format which complements ldif(5) and the technical specification RFC2849.

 The basic form of an entry is:

         # comment
         dn: <distinguished name>
         <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
         <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
    
         ...

 Lines starting with a '#' character are comments. An attribute description may be a simple attribute type like cn or objectClass or 1.2.3 (an OID associated with an attribute type) or may include options such as cn;lang_en_US or userCertificate;binary.

 A line may be continued by starting the next line with a single space or tab character. For example:

         dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=
          com
         cn: Barbara J
           Jensen

 is equivalent to:

         dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
         cn: Barbara J Jensen

 Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines. e.g.,

         cn: Barbara J Jensen
         cn: Babs Jensen

 If an <attrvalue> contains non-printing characters or begins with a space, a colon (':'), or a less than ('<'), the <attrdesc> is followed by a double colon and the base64 encoding of the value. For example, the value " begins with a space" would be encoded like this:

         cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=

 You can also specify a URL containing the attribute value. For example, the following specifies the jpegPhoto value should be obtained from the file /path/to/file.jpeg.

         cn:< file:///path/to/file.jpeg

 Multiple entries within the same LDIF file are separated by blank lines. Here's an example of an LDIF file containing three entries.

         # Barbara's Entry
         dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
         cn: Barbara J Jensen
         cn: Babs Jensen
         objectClass: person
         sn: Jensen
    
         # Bjorn's Entry
         dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
         cn: Bjorn J Jensen
         cn: Bjorn Jensen
         objectClass: person
         sn: Jensen
         # Base64 encoded JPEG photo
         jpegPhoto:: /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAAAAAQABAAD/2wBDABALD
          A4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQ
          ERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVG
    
         # Jennifer's Entry
         dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
         cn: Jennifer J Jensen
         cn: Jennifer Jensen
         objectClass: person
         sn: Jensen
         # JPEG photo from file
         jpegPhoto:< file:///path/to/file.jpeg

 Notice that the jpegPhoto in Bjorn's entry is base 64 encoded and the jpegPhoto in Jennifer's entry is obtained from the location indicated by the URL.

 Note: Trailing spaces are not trimmed from values in an LDIF file. Nor are multiple internal spaces compressed. If you don't want them in your data, don't put them there.

 11. Backends

 Backends do the actual work of storing or retrieving data in response to LDAP requests. Backends may be compiled statically into slapd, or when module support is enabled, they may be dynamically loaded.

 If your installation uses dynamic modules, you may need to add the relevant moduleload directives to the examples that follow. The name of the module for a backend is usually of the form:

         back_<backend name>.la

 So for example, if you need to load the hdb backend, you would configure

         moduleload back_hdb.la

 11.1. Berkeley DB Backends
 11.1.1. Overview

 The hdb backend to slapd(8) is a backend for a normal slapd database. It uses the Oracle Berkeley DB (BDB) package to store data. It makes extensive use of indexing and caching (see the Tuning section) to speed data access.

 hdb is a variant of the original bdb backend which was first written for use with BDB. hdb uses a hierarchical database layout which supports subtree renames. It is otherwise identical to the bdb behavior, and all the same configuration options apply.

 Note: An hdb database needs a large idlcachesize for good search performance, typically three times the cachesize (entry cache size) or larger.

 Note: The hdb backend has superseded the bdb backend, and both will soon be deprecated in favor of the new mdb backend. See below.

 11.1.2. back-bdb/back-hdb Configuration

 MORE LATER
 11.1.3. Further Information

 slapd-bdb(5)
 11.2. LDAP
 11.2.1. Overview

 The LDAP backend to slapd(8) is not an actual database; instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming requests to another LDAP server. While processing requests it will also chase referrals, so that referrals are fully processed instead of being returned to the slapd client.

 Sessions that explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database always create their own private connection to the remote LDAP server. Anonymous sessions will share a single anonymous connection to the remote server. For sessions bound through other mechanisms, all sessions with the same DN will share the same connection. This connection pooling strategy can enhance the proxy's efficiency by reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple connections.

 The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e. the identity of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the remote server, possibly in some modified form. For this purpose, the proxy binds to the remote server with some administrative identity, and, if required, authorizes the asserted identity.

 It is heavily used by a lot of other Backends and Overlays.
 11.2.2. back-ldap Configuration

 As previously mentioned, slapd-ldap(5) is used behind the scenes by many other Backends and Overlays. Some of them merely provide a few configuration directive themselves, but have available to the administrator the whole of the slapd-ldap(5) options.

 For example, the Translucent Proxy, which retrieves entries from a remote LDAP server that can be partially overridden by the defined database, has only four specific translucent- directives, but can be configured using any of the normal slapd-ldap(5) options. See {[slapo-translucent(5)}} for details.

 Other Overlays allow you to tag directives in front of a normal slapd-ldap(5) directive. For example, the slapo-chain(5) overlay does this:

 "There are very few chain overlay specific directives; however, directives related to the instances of the ldap backend that may be implicitly instantiated by the overlay may assume a special meaning when used in conjunction with this overlay. They are described in slapd-ldap(5), and they also need to be prefixed by chain-."

 You may have also seen the slapd-ldap(5) backend used and described in the Push Based Replication section of the guide.

 It should therefore be obvious that the slapd-ldap(5) backend is extremely flexible and heavily used throughout the OpenLDAP Suite.

 The following is a very simple example, but already the power of the slapd-ldap(5) backend is seen by use of a uri list:

         database        ldap
         suffix          "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
         rootdn          "cn=slapd-ldap"
         uri             ldap://localhost/ ldap://remotehost ldap://remotehost2

 The URI list is space or comma-separated. Whenever the server that responds is not the first one in the list, the list is rearranged and the responsive server is moved to the head, so that it will be first contacted the next time a connection needs be created.

 This feature can be used to provide a form of load balancing when using MirrorMode replication.
 11.2.3. Further Information

 slapd-ldap(5)
 11.3. LDIF
 11.3.1. Overview

 The LDIF backend to slapd(8) is a basic storage backend that stores entries in text files in LDIF format, and exploits the filesystem to create the tree structure of the database. It is intended as a cheap, low performance easy to use backend.

 When using the cn=config dynamic configuration database with persistent storage, the configuration data is stored using this backend. See slapd-config(5) for more information
 11.3.2. back-ldif Configuration

 Like many other backends, the LDIF backend can be instantiated with very few configuration lines:

         include ./schema/core.schema
    
         database  ldif
         directory ./ldif
         suffix    "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
         rootdn    "cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
         rootpw    LDIF

 If we add the dcObject for dc=suretecsystems,dc=com, you can see how this is added behind the scenes on the file system:

    dn: dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
    objectClass: dcObject
    objectClass: organization
    dc: suretecsystems
    o: Suretec Systems Ltd

 Now we add it to the directory:

    ldapadd -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -f suretec.ldif -D "cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" -w LDIF
    adding new entry "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"

 And inside ./ldif we have:

    ls ./ldif
    dc=suretecsystems,dc=com.ldif

 which again contains:

    cat ldif/dc\=suretecsystems\,dc\=com.ldif
    
    dn: dc=suretecsystems
    objectClass: dcObject
    objectClass: organization
    dc: suretecsystems
    o: Suretec Systems Ltd.
    structuralObjectClass: organization
    entryUUID: 2134b714-e3a1-102c-9a15-f96ee263886d
    creatorsName: cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
    createTimestamp: 20080711142643Z
    entryCSN: 20080711142643.661124Z#000000#000#000000
    modifiersName: cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
    modifyTimestamp: 20080711142643Z

 This is the complete format you would get when exporting your directory using slapcat etc.
 11.3.3. Further Information

 slapd-ldif(5)
 11.4. LMDB
 11.4.1. Overview

 The mdb backend to slapd(8) is the recommended primary backend for a normal slapd database. It uses OpenLDAP's own Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) library to store data and is intended to replace the Berkeley DB backends.

 It supports indexing like the BDB backends, but it uses no caching and requires no tuning to deliver maximum search performance. Like hdb, it is also fully hierarchical and supports subtree renames in constant time.
 11.4.2. back-mdb Configuration

 Unlike the BDB backends, the mdb backend can be instantiated with very few configuration lines:

         include ./schema/core.schema
    
         database  mdb
         directory ./mdb
         suffix    "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
         rootdn    "cn=mdb,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
         rootpw    mdb
         maxsize   1073741824

 In addition to the usual parameters that a minimal configuration requires, the mdb backend requires a maximum size to be set. This should be the largest that the database is ever anticipated to grow (in bytes). The filesystem must also provide enough free space to accommodate this size.
 11.4.3. Further Information

 slapd-mdb(5)
 11.5. Metadirectory
 11.5.1. Overview

 The meta backend to slapd(8) performs basic LDAP proxying with respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets". The information contained in these servers can be presented as belonging to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).

 A basic knowledge of the functionality of the slapd-ldap(5) backend is recommended. This backend has been designed as an enhancement of the ldap backend. The two backends share many features (actually they also share portions of code). While the ldap backend is intended to proxy operations directed to a single server, the meta backend is mainly intended for proxying of multiple servers and possibly naming context masquerading.

 These features, although useful in many scenarios, may result in excessive overhead for some applications, so its use should be carefully considered.
 11.5.2. back-meta Configuration

 LATER
 11.5.3. Further Information

 slapd-meta(5)
 11.6. Monitor
 11.6.1. Overview

 The monitor backend to slapd(8) is not an actual database; if enabled, it is automatically generated and dynamically maintained by slapd with information about the running status of the daemon.

 To inspect all monitor information, issue a subtree search with base cn=Monitor, requesting that attributes "+" and "*" are returned. The monitor backend produces mostly operational attributes, and LDAP only returns operational attributes that are explicitly requested. Requesting attribute "+" is an extension which requests all operational attributes.

 See the Monitoring section.
 11.6.2. back-monitor Configuration

 The monitor database can be instantiated only once, i.e. only one occurrence of "database monitor" can occur in the slapd.conf(5) file. Also the suffix is automatically set to "cn=Monitor".

 You can however set a rootdn and rootpw. The following is all that is needed to instantiate a monitor backend:

         include ./schema/core.schema
    
         database monitor
         rootdn "cn=monitoring,cn=Monitor"
         rootpw monitoring

 You can also apply Access Control to this database like any other database, for example:

         access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"
              by dn.exact="uid=Admin,dc=my,dc=org" write
              by users read
              by * none

 Note: The core.schema must be loaded for the monitor database to work.

 A small example of the data returned via ldapsearch would be:

         ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -b 'cn=Monitor'
         # extended LDIF
         #
         # LDAPv3
         # base <cn=Monitor> with scope subtree
         # filter: (objectclass=*)
         # requesting: ALL
         #
    
         # Monitor
         dn: cn=Monitor
         objectClass: monitorServer
         cn: Monitor
         description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
         description: This object contains information about this server.
         description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
          must be explicitly requested.
    
         # Backends, Monitor
         dn: cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
         objectClass: monitorContainer
         cn: Backends
         description: This subsystem contains information about available backends.

 Please see the Monitoring section for complete examples of information available via this backend.
 11.6.3. Further Information

 slapd-monitor(5)
 11.7. Null
 11.7.1. Overview

 The Null backend to slapd(8) is surely the most useful part of slapd:

     Searches return success but no entries.
     Compares return compareFalse.
     Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
     Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option "bind on" is given.
     The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are equally exciting.

 Inspired by the /dev/null device.
 11.7.2. back-null Configuration

 This has to be one of the shortest configurations you'll ever do. In order to test this, your slapd.conf file would look like:

         database null
         suffix "cn=Nothing"
         bind on

 bind on means:

 "Allow binds as any DN in this backend's suffix, with any password. The default is "off"."

 To test this backend with ldapsearch:

         ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -D "uid=none,cn=Nothing" -w testing -b 'cn=Nothing'
         # extended LDIF
         #
         # LDAPv3
         # base <cn=Nothing> with scope subtree
         # filter: (objectclass=*)
         # requesting: ALL
         #
    
         # search result
         search: 2
         result: 0 Success
    
         # numResponses: 1

 11.7.3. Further Information

 slapd-null(5)
 11.8. Passwd
 11.8.1. Overview

 The PASSWD backend to slapd(8) serves up the user account information listed in the system passwd(5) file (defaulting to /etc/passwd).

 This backend is provided for demonstration purposes only. The DN of each entry is "uid=<username>,<suffix>".
 11.8.2. back-passwd Configuration

 The configuration using slapd.conf a slightly longer, but not much. For example:

         include ./schema/core.schema
    
         database passwd
         suffix "cn=passwd"

 Again, testing this with ldapsearch would result in something like:

         ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -b 'cn=passwd'
         # extended LDIF
         #
         # LDAPv3
         # base <cn=passwd> with scope subtree
         # filter: (objectclass=*)

 11.9. Perl/Shell
 11.9.1. Overview

 The Perl backend to slapd(8) works by embedding a perl(1) interpreter into slapd(8). Any perl database section of the configuration file slapd.conf(5) must then specify what Perl module to use. Slapd then creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that particular instance of the backend.

 The Shell backend to slapd(8) executes external programs to implement operations, and is designed to make it easy to tie an existing database to the slapd front-end. This backend is is primarily intended to be used in prototypes.

 11.10. Relay
 11.10.1. Overview

 The primary purpose of this slapd(8) backend is to map a naming context defined in a database running in the same slapd(8) instance into a virtual naming context, with attributeType and objectClass manipulation, if required. It requires the rwm overlay.

 This backend and the above mentioned overlay are experimental.

 11.11. SQL
 11.11.1. Overview

 The primary purpose of this slapd(8) backend is to PRESENT information stored in some RDBMS as an LDAP subtree without any programming (some SQL and maybe stored procedures can't be considered programming, anyway ;).

 That is, for example, when you (some ISP) have account information you use in an RDBMS, and want to use modern solutions that expect such information in LDAP (to authenticate users, make email lookups etc.). Or you want to synchronize or distribute information between different sites/applications that use RDBMSes and/or LDAP. Or whatever else...

 It is NOT designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS instead of BerkeleyDB (as the standard BDB backend does), though it can be used as such with several limitations. Please see LDAP vs RDBMS for discussion.

 The idea is to use some meta-information to translate LDAP queries to SQL queries, leaving relational schema untouched, so that old applications can continue using it without any modifications. This allows SQL and LDAP applications to interoperate without replication, and exchange data as needed.

 The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational schema without having to change source (through that meta-information mentioned). Also, it uses ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and is highly configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes may use, so it may be used for integration and distribution of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environments.

 This backend is experimental.
 11.11.2. back-sql Configuration

 This backend has to be one of the most abused and complex backends there is. Therefore, we will go through a simple, small example that comes with the OpenLDAP source and can be found in servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/README

 For this example we will be using PostgreSQL.

 First, we add to /etc/odbc.ini a block of the form:

         [example]                        <===
         Description         = Example for OpenLDAP's back-sql
         Driver              = PostgreSQL
         Trace               = No
         Database            = example    <===
         Servername          = localhost
         UserName            = manager    <===
         Password            = secret     <===
         Port                = 5432
         ;Protocol            = 6.4
         ReadOnly            = No
         RowVersioning       = No
         ShowSystemTables    = No
         ShowOidColumn       = No
         FakeOidIndex        = No
         ConnSettings        =

 The relevant information for our test setup is highlighted with '<===' on the right above.

 Next, we add to /etc/odbcinst.ini a block of the form:

         [PostgreSQL]
         Description     = ODBC for PostgreSQL
         Driver          = /usr/lib/libodbcpsql.so
         Setup           = /usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so
         FileUsage       = 1

 We will presume you know how to create a database and user in PostgreSQL and how to set a password. Also, we'll presume you can populate the 'example' database you've just created with the following files, as found in servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/pgsql

         backsql_create.sql, testdb_create.sql, testdb_data.sql, testdb_metadata.sql

 Lastly, run the test:

         [root@localhost]# cd $SOURCES/tests
         [root@localhost]# SLAPD_USE_SQL=pgsql ./run sql-test000

 Briefly, you should see something like (cut short for space):

         Cleaning up test run directory leftover from previous run.
         Running ./scripts/sql-test000-read...
         running defines.sh
         Starting slapd on TCP/IP port 9011...
         Testing SQL backend read operations...
         Waiting 5 seconds for slapd to start...
         Testing correct bind... dn:cn=Mitya Kovalev,dc=example,dc=com
         Testing incorrect bind (should fail)... ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)
    
         ......
    
         Filtering original ldif...
         Comparing filter output...
         >>>>> Test succeeded

 The test is basically readonly; this can be performed by all RDBMSes (listed above).

 There is another test, sql-test900-write, which is currently enabled only for PostgreSQL and IBM db2.

 Using sql-test000, files in servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/pgsql/ and the man page, you should be set.

 Note: This backend is experimental.

 12. Overlays

 Overlays are software components that provide hooks to functions analogous to those provided by backends, which can be stacked on top of the backend calls and as callbacks on top of backend responses to alter their behavior.

 Overlays may be compiled statically into slapd, or when module support is enabled, they may be dynamically loaded. Most of the overlays are only allowed to be configured on individual databases.

 Some can be stacked on the frontend as well, for global use. This means that they can be executed after a request is parsed and validated, but right before the appropriate database is selected. The main purpose is to affect operations regardless of the database they will be handled by, and, in some cases, to influence the selection of the database by massaging the request DN.

 Essentially, overlays represent a means to:

     customize the behavior of existing backends without changing the backend code and without requiring one to write a new custom backend with complete functionality
     write functionality of general usefulness that can be applied to different backend types

 When using slapd.conf(5), overlays that are configured before any other databases are considered global, as mentioned above. In fact they are implicitly stacked on top of the frontend database. They can also be explicitly configured as such:

         database frontend
         overlay <overlay name>

 Overlays are usually documented by separate specific man pages in section 5; the naming convention is

         slapo-<overlay name>

 All distributed core overlays have a man page. Feel free to contribute to any, if you think there is anything missing in describing the behavior of the component and the implications of all the related configuration directives.

 Official overlays are located in

         servers/slapd/overlays/

 That directory also contains the file slapover.txt, which describes the rationale of the overlay implementation, and may serve as a guideline for the development of custom overlays.

 Contribware overlays are located in

         contrib/slapd-modules/<overlay name>/

 along with other types of run-time loadable components; they are officially distributed, but not maintained by the project.

 All the current overlays in OpenLDAP are listed and described in detail in the following sections.
 12.1. Access Logging
 12.1.1. Overview

 This overlay can record accesses to a given backend database on another database.

 This allows all of the activity on a given database to be reviewed using arbitrary LDAP queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files. Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log records from the logging database. Log records are stored with audit schema to assure their readability whether viewed as LDIF or in raw form.

 It is also used for delta-syncrepl replication
 12.1.2. Access Logging Configuration

 The following is a basic example that implements Access Logging:

         database bdb
         suffix dc=example,dc=com
         ...
         overlay accesslog
         logdb cn=log
         logops writes reads
         logold (objectclass=person)
    
         database bdb
         suffix cn=log
         ...
         index reqStart eq
         access to *
           by dn.base="cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" read

 The following is an example used for delta-syncrepl replication:

         database hdb
         suffix cn=accesslog
         directory /usr/local/var/openldap-accesslog
         rootdn cn=accesslog
         index default eq
         index entryCSN,objectClass,reqEnd,reqResult,reqStart

 Accesslog overlay definitions for the primary db

         database bdb
         suffix dc=example,dc=com
         ...
         overlay accesslog
         logdb cn=accesslog
         logops writes
         logsuccess TRUE
         # scan the accesslog DB every day, and purge entries older than 7 days
         logpurge 07+00:00 01+00:00

 An example search result against cn=accesslog might look like:

         [ghenry@suretec ghenry]# ldapsearch -x -b cn=accesslog
         # extended LDIF
         #
         # LDAPv3
         # base <cn=accesslog> with scope subtree
         # filter: (objectclass=*)
         # requesting: ALL
         #
    
         # accesslog
         dn: cn=accesslog
         objectClass: auditContainer
         cn: accesslog
    
         # 20080110163829.000004Z, accesslog
         dn: reqStart=20080110163829.000004Z,cn=accesslog
         objectClass: auditModify
         reqStart: 20080110163829.000004Z
         reqEnd: 20080110163829.000005Z
         reqType: modify
         reqSession: 196696
         reqAuthzID: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
         reqDN: uid=suretec-46022f8$,ou=Users,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
         reqResult: 0

         reqMod: sambaPwdLastSet:+ ###CENSORED###
         reqMod: entryCSN:= 20080110163829.095157Z#000000#000#000000
         reqMod: modifiersName:= cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
         reqMod: modifyTimestamp:= 20080110163829Z
    
         # search result
         search: 2
         result: 0 Success

 12.2. Audit Logging

 The Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a given backend database to a specified log file.
 12.2.1. Overview

 If the need arises whereby changes need to be logged as standard LDIF, then the auditlog overlay slapo-auditlog (5) can be used. Full examples are available in the man page slapo-auditlog (5)
 12.2.2. Audit Logging Configuration

 If the directory is running vi slapd.d, then the following LDIF could be used to add the overlay to the overlay list in cn=config and set what file the LDIF gets logged to (adjust to suit)

        dn: olcOverlay=auditlog,olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
        changetype: add
        objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
        objectClass: olcAuditLogConfig
        olcOverlay: auditlog
        olcAuditlogFile: /tmp/auditlog.ldif

 In this example for testing, we are logging changes to /tmp/auditlog.ldif

 A typical LDIF file created by slapo-auditlog(5) would look like:

        # add 1196797576 dc=suretecsystems,dc=com cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        dn: dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        changetype: add
        objectClass: dcObject
        objectClass: organization
        dc: suretecsystems
        o: Suretec Systems Ltd.
        structuralObjectClass: organization
        entryUUID: 1606f8f8-f06e-1029-8289-f0cc9d81e81a
        creatorsName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        modifiersName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        createTimestamp: 20051123130912Z
        modifyTimestamp: 20051123130912Z
        entryCSN: 20051123130912.000000Z#000001#000#000000
        auditContext: cn=accesslog
        # end add 1196797576
    
        # add 1196797577 dc=suretecsystems,dc=com cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        dn: ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        changetype: add
        objectClass: top
        objectClass: organizationalUnit
        ou: Groups

 12.3. Chaining
 12.3.1. Overview

 The chain overlay provides basic chaining capability to the underlying database.

 What is chaining? It indicates the capability of a DSA to follow referrals on behalf of the client, so that distributed systems are viewed as a single virtual DSA by clients that are otherwise unable to "chase" (i.e. follow) referrals by themselves.

 The chain overlay is built on top of the ldap backend; it is compiled by default when --enable-ldap.
 12.3.2. Chaining Configuration

 In order to demonstrate how this overlay works, we shall discuss a typical scenario which might be one master server and three Syncrepl slaves.

 On each replica, add this near the top of the slapd.conf(5) file (global), before any database definitions:

         overlay                    chain
         chain-uri                  "ldap://ldapmaster.example.com"
         chain-idassert-bind        bindmethod="simple"
                                    binddn="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
                                    credentials="<secret>"
                                    mode="self"
         chain-tls                  start
         chain-return-error         TRUE

 Add this below your syncrepl statement:

         updateref                  "ldap://ldapmaster.example.com/"

 The chain-tls statement enables TLS from the slave to the ldap master. The DITs are exactly the same between these machines, therefore whatever user bound to the slave will also exist on the master. If that DN does not have update privileges on the master, nothing will happen.

 You will need to restart the slave after these slapd.conf changes. Then, if you are using loglevel stats (256), you can monitor an ldapmodify on the slave and the master. (If you're using cn=config no restart is required.)

 Now start an ldapmodify on the slave and watch the logs. You should expect something like:

         Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 ACCEPT from IP=143.199.102.216:45181 (IP=143.199.102.216:389)
         Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=0 STARTTLS
         Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=0 RESULT oid= err=0 text=
         Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 TLS established tls_ssf=256 ssf=256
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 BIND dn="uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" method=128
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 BIND dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" mech=SIMPLE ssf=0
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 RESULT tag=97 err=0 text=
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 MOD dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 MOD attr=mail
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 RESULT tag=103 err=0 text=
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=3 UNBIND
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 closed
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: LDAP_RES_SEARCH_ENTRY(LDAP_SYNC_MODIFY)
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: be_search (0)
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
         Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: be_modify (0)

 And on the master you will see this:

         Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 PROXYAUTHZ dn="uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
         Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 MOD dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
         Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 MOD attr=mail
         Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 RESULT tag=103 err=0 text=

 Note: You can clearly see the PROXYAUTHZ line on the master, indicating the proper identity assertion for the update on the master. Also note the slave immediately receiving the Syncrepl update from the master.

 12.3.3. Handling Chaining Errors

 By default, if chaining fails, the original referral is returned to the client under the assumption that the client might want to try and follow the referral.

 With the following directive however, if the chaining fails at the provider side, the actual error is returned to the client.

         chain-return-error TRUE

 12.3.4. Read-Back of Chained Modifications

 Occasionally, applications want to read back the data that they just wrote. If a modification requested to a shadow server was silently chained to its provider, an immediate read could result in receiving data not yet synchronized. In those cases, clients should use the dontusecopy control to ensure they are directed to the authoritative source for that piece of data.

 This control usually causes a referral to the actual source of the data to be returned. However, when the slapo-chain(5) overlay is used, it intercepts the referral being returned in response to the dontusecopy control, and tries to fetch the requested data.
 12.3.5. Further Information

 slapo-chain(5)
 12.4. Constraints
 12.4.1. Overview

 This overlay enforces a regular expression constraint on all values of specified attributes during an LDAP modify request that contains add or modify commands. It is used to enforce a more rigorous syntax when the underlying attribute syntax is too general.
 12.4.2. Constraint Configuration

 Configuration via slapd.conf(5) would look like:

         overlay constraint
         constraint_attribute mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
         constraint_attribute title uri
         ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)

 A specification like the above would reject any mail attribute which did not look like <alpha-numeric string>@mydomain.com.

 It would also reject any title attribute whose values were not listed in the title attribute of any titleCatalog entries in the given scope.

 An example for use with cn=config:

        dn: olcOverlay=constraint,olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
        changetype: add
        objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
        objectClass: olcConstraintConfig
        olcOverlay: constraint
        olcConstraintAttribute: mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
        olcConstraintAttribute: title uri ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)

 12.4.3. Further Information

 slapo-constraint(5)
 12.5. Dynamic Directory Services
 12.5.1. Overview

 The dds overlay to slapd(8) implements dynamic objects as per RFC2589. The name dds stands for Dynamic Directory Services. It allows to define dynamic objects, characterized by the dynamicObject objectClass.

 Dynamic objects have a limited lifetime, determined by a time-to-live (TTL) that can be refreshed by means of a specific refresh extended operation. This operation allows to set the Client Refresh Period (CRP), namely the period between refreshes that is required to preserve the dynamic object from expiration. The expiration time is computed by adding the requested TTL to the current time. When dynamic objects reach the end of their lifetime without being further refreshed, they are automatically deleted. There is no guarantee of immediate deletion, so clients should not count on it.
 12.5.2. Dynamic Directory Service Configuration

 A usage of dynamic objects might be to implement dynamic meetings; in this case, all the participants to the meeting are allowed to refresh the meeting object, but only the creator can delete it (otherwise it will be deleted when the TTL expires).

 If we add the overlay to an example database, specifying a Max TTL of 1 day, a min of 10 seconds, with a default TTL of 1 hour. We'll also specify an interval of 120 (less than 60s might be too small) seconds between expiration checks and a tolerance of 5 second (lifetime of a dynamic object will be entryTtl + tolerance).

        overlay dds
        dds-max-ttl     1d
        dds-min-ttl     10s
        dds-default-ttl 1h
        dds-interval    120s
        dds-tolerance   5s

 and add an index:

        entryExpireTimestamp

 Creating a meeting is as simple as adding the following:

        dn: cn=OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting,ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: groupOfNames
        objectClass: dynamicObject
        cn: OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting
        member: uid=ghenry,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        member: uid=hyc,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

 12.5.2.1. Dynamic Directory Service ACLs

 Allow users to start a meeting and to join it; restrict refresh to the member; restrict delete to the creator:

        access to attrs=userPassword
           by self write
           by * read
    
        access to dn.base="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                  attrs=children
             by users write
    
        access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                  attrs=entry
             by dnattr=creatorsName write
             by * read
    
        access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                  attrs=participant
             by dnattr=creatorsName write
             by users selfwrite
             by * read
    
        access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                  attrs=entryTtl
             by dnattr=member manage
             by * read

 In simple terms, the user who created the OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting can add new attendees, refresh the meeting using (basically complete control):

        ldapexop -x -H ldap://ldaphost "refresh" "cn=OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting,ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com" "120" -D "uid=ghenry,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -W

 Any user can join the meeting, but not add another attendee, but they can refresh the meeting. The ACLs above are quite straight forward to understand.

 12.6. Dynamic Groups
 12.6.1. Overview

 This overlay extends the Compare operation to detect members of a dynamic group. This overlay is now deprecated as all of its functions are available using the Dynamic Lists overlay.
 12.6.2. Dynamic Group Configuration
 12.7. Dynamic Lists
 12.7.1. Overview

 This overlay allows expansion of dynamic groups and lists. Instead of having the group members or list attributes hard coded, this overlay allows us to define an LDAP search whose results will make up the group or list.
 12.7.2. Dynamic List Configuration

 This module can behave both as a dynamic list and dynamic group, depending on the configuration. The syntax is as follows:

        overlay dynlist
        dynlist-attrset <group-oc> <URL-ad> [member-ad]

 The parameters to the dynlist-attrset directive have the following meaning:

     <group-oc>: specifies which object class triggers the subsequent LDAP search. Whenever an entry with this object class is retrieved, the search is performed.
     <URL-ad>: is the name of the attribute which holds the search URI. It has to be a subtype of labeledURI. The attributes and values present in the search result are added to the entry unless member-ad is used (see below).
     member-ad: if present, changes the overlay behavior into a dynamic group. Instead of inserting the results of the search in the entry, the distinguished name of the results are added as values of this attribute.

 Here is an example which will allow us to have an email alias which automatically expands to all user's emails according to our LDAP filter:

 In slapd.conf(5):

        overlay dynlist
        dynlist-attrset nisMailAlias labeledURI

 This means that whenever an entry which has the nisMailAlias object class is retrieved, the search specified in the labeledURI attribute is performed.

 Let's say we have this entry in our directory:

        cn=all,ou=aliases,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: all
        objectClass: nisMailAlias
        labeledURI: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?one?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

 If this entry is retrieved, the search specified in labeledURI will be performed and the results will be added to the entry just as if they have always been there. In this case, the search filter selects all entries directly under ou=People that have the inetOrgPerson object class and retrieves the mail attribute, if it exists.

 This is what gets added to the entry when we have two users under ou=People that match the filter:

 Figure X.Y: Dynamic List for all emails

 The configuration for a dynamic group is similar. Let's see an example which would automatically populate an allusers group with all the user accounts in the directory.

 In slapd.conf(5):

        include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
        ...
        overlay dynlist
        dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs labeledURI member
    
     Note: We must include the dyngroup.schema file that defines the
     groupOfURLs objectClass used in this example.

 Let's apply it to the following entry:

        cn=allusers,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: all
        objectClass: groupOfURLs
        labeledURI: ldap:///ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

 The behavior is similar to the dynamic list configuration we had before: whenever an entry with the groupOfURLs object class is retrieved, the search specified in the labeledURI attribute is performed. But this time, only the distinguished names of the results are added, and as values of the member attribute.

 This is what we get:

 Figure X.Y: Dynamic Group for all users

 Note that a side effect of this scheme of dynamic groups is that the members need to be specified as full DNs. So, if you are planning in using this for posixGroups, be sure to use RFC2307bis and some attribute which can hold distinguished names. The memberUid attribute used in the posixGroup object class can hold only names, not DNs, and is therefore not suitable for dynamic groups.

 12.8. Reverse Group Membership Maintenance
 12.8.1. Overview

 In some scenarios, it may be desirable for a client to be able to determine which groups an entry is a member of, without performing an additional search. Examples of this are applications using the DIT for access control based on group authorization.

 The memberof overlay updates an attribute (by default memberOf) whenever changes occur to the membership attribute (by default member) of entries of the objectclass (by default groupOfNames) configured to trigger updates.

 Thus, it provides maintenance of the list of groups an entry is a member of, when usual maintenance of groups is done by modifying the members on the group entry.
 12.8.2. Member Of Configuration

 The typical use of this overlay requires just enabling the overlay for a specific database. For example, with the following minimal slapd.conf:

         include /usr/share/openldap/schema/core.schema
         include /usr/share/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
    
         authz-regexp "gidNumber=0\\\+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth"
                 "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
         database        bdb
         suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
         rootdn          "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
         rootpw          secret
         directory       /var/lib/ldap2.4
         checkpoint 256 5
         index   objectClass   eq
         index   uid           eq,sub
    
         overlay memberof

 adding the following ldif:

         cat memberof.ldif
         dn: dc=example,dc=com
         objectclass: domain
         dc: example
    
         dn: ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
         objectclass: organizationalUnit
         ou: Group
    
         dn: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
         objectclass: organizationalUnit
         ou: People
    
         dn: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
         objectclass: account
         uid: test1
    
         dn: cn=testgroup,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
         objectclass: groupOfNames
         cn: testgroup
         member: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

 Results in the following output from a search on the test1 user:

  # ldapsearch -LL -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// "(uid=test1)" -b dc=example,dc=com memberOf
  SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started
  SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
  SASL SSF: 0
  version: 1

  dn: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
  memberOf: cn=testgroup,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com

 Note that the memberOf attribute is an operational attribute, so it must be requested explicitly.

 12.9. The Proxy Cache Engine

 LDAP servers typically hold one or more subtrees of a DIT. Replica (or shadow) servers hold shadow copies of entries held by one or more master servers. Changes are propagated from the master server to replica (slave) servers using LDAP Sync replication. An LDAP cache is a special type of replica which holds entries corresponding to search filters instead of subtrees.
 12.9.1. Overview

 The proxy cache extension of slapd is designed to improve the responsiveness of the ldap and meta backends. It handles a search request (query) by first determining whether it is contained in any cached search filter. Contained requests are answered from the proxy cache's local database. Other requests are passed on to the underlying ldap or meta backend and processed as usual.

 E.g. (shoesize>=9) is contained in (shoesize>=8) and (sn=Richardson) is contained in (sn=Richards*)

 Correct matching rules and syntaxes are used while comparing assertions for query containment. To simplify the query containment problem, a list of cacheable "templates" (defined below) is specified at configuration time. A query is cached or answered only if it belongs to one of these templates. The entries corresponding to cached queries are stored in the proxy cache local database while its associated meta information (filter, scope, base, attributes) is stored in main memory.

 A template is a prototype for generating LDAP search requests. Templates are described by a prototype search filter and a list of attributes which are required in queries generated from the template. The representation for prototype filter is similar to RFC4515, except that the assertion values are missing. Examples of prototype filters are: (sn=),(&(sn=)(givenname=)) which are instantiated by search filters (sn=Doe) and (&(sn=Doe)(givenname=John)) respectively.

 The cache replacement policy removes the least recently used (LRU) query and entries belonging to only that query. Queries are allowed a maximum time to live (TTL) in the cache thus providing weak consistency. A background task periodically checks the cache for expired queries and removes them.

 The Proxy Cache paper (http://www.openldap.org/pub/kapurva/proxycaching.pdf) provides design and implementation details.
 12.9.2. Proxy Cache Configuration

 The cache configuration specific directives described below must appear after a overlay pcache directive within a "database meta" or "database ldap" section of the server's slapd.conf(5) file.
 12.9.2.1. Setting cache parameters

  pcache <DB> <maxentries> <nattrsets> <entrylimit> <period>

 This directive enables proxy caching and sets general cache parameters. The <DB> parameter specifies which underlying database is to be used to hold cached entries. It should be set to bdb or hdb. The <maxentries> parameter specifies the total number of entries which may be held in the cache. The <nattrsets> parameter specifies the total number of attribute sets (as specified by the pcacheAttrset directive) that may be defined. The <entrylimit> parameter specifies the maximum number of entries in a cacheable query. The <period> specifies the consistency check period (in seconds). In each period, queries with expired TTLs are removed.
 12.9.2.2. Defining attribute sets

  pcacheAttrset <index> <attrs...>

 Used to associate a set of attributes to an index. Each attribute set is associated with an index number from 0 to <numattrsets>-1. These indices are used by the pcacheTemplate directive to define cacheable templates.
 12.9.2.3. Specifying cacheable templates

  pcacheTemplate <prototype_string> <attrset_index> <TTL>

 Specifies a cacheable template and the "time to live" (in sec) <TTL> for queries belonging to the template. A template is described by its prototype filter string and set of required attributes identified by <attrset_index>.
 12.9.2.4. Example for slapd.conf

 An example slapd.conf(5) database section for a caching server which proxies for the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree held at server ldap.example.com.

         database        ldap
         suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
         rootdn          "dc=example,dc=com"
         uri             ldap://ldap.example.com/
         overlay pcache
         pcache         hdb 100000 1 1000 100
         pcacheAttrset  0 mail postaladdress telephonenumber
         pcacheTemplate (sn=) 0 3600
         pcacheTemplate (&(sn=)(givenName=)) 0 3600
         pcacheTemplate (&(departmentNumber=)(secretary=*)) 0 3600
    
         cachesize 20
         directory ./testrun/db.2.a
         index       objectClass eq
         index       cn,sn,uid,mail  pres,eq,sub

 12.9.2.5. Example for slapd-config

 The same example as a LDIF file for back-config for a caching server which proxies for the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree held at server ldap.example.com.

    dn: olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
    objectClass: olcLDAPConfig
    olcDatabase: {2}ldap
    olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
    olcRootDN: dc=example,dc=com
    olcDbURI: "ldap://ldap.example.com"
    
    dn: olcOverlay={0}pcache,olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
    objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
    objectClass: olcPcacheConfig
    olcOverlay: {0}pcache
    olcPcache: hdb 100000 1 1000 100
    olcPcacheAttrset: 0 mail postalAddress telephoneNumber
    olcPcacheTemplate: "(sn=)" 0 3600 0 0 0
    olcPcacheTemplate: "(&(sn=)(givenName=))" 0 3600 0 0 0
    olcPcacheTemplate: "(&(departmentNumber=)(secretary=))" 0 3600
    
    dn: olcDatabase={0}hdb,olcOverlay={0}pcache,olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
    objectClass: olcHdbConfig
    objectClass: olcPcacheDatabase
    olcDatabase: {0}hdb
    olcDbDirectory: ./testrun/db.2.a
    olcDbCacheSize: 20
    olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
    olcDbIndex: cn,sn,uid,mail  pres,eq,sub

 12.9.2.5.1. Cacheable Queries

 A LDAP search query is cacheable when its filter matches one of the templates as defined in the "pcacheTemplate" statements and when it references only the attributes specified in the corresponding attribute set. In the example above the attribute set number 0 defines that only the attributes: mail postaladdress telephonenumber are cached for the following pcacheTemplates.
 12.9.2.5.2. Examples:

         Filter: (&(sn=Richard*)(givenName=jack))
         Attrs: mail telephoneNumber

 is cacheable, because it matches the template (&(sn=)(givenName=)) and its attributes are contained in pcacheAttrset 0.

         Filter: (&(sn=Richard*)(telephoneNumber))
         Attrs: givenName

 is not cacheable, because the filter does not match the template, nor is the attribute givenName stored in the cache

         Filter: (|(sn=Richard*)(givenName=jack))
         Attrs: mail telephoneNumber

 is not cacheable, because the filter does not match the template ( logical OR "|" condition instead of logical AND "&" )

 12.10. Password Policies
 12.10.1. Overview

 This overlay follows the specifications contained in the draft RFC titled draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-09. While the draft itself is expired, it has been implemented in several directory servers, including slapd. Nonetheless, it is important to note that it is a draft, meaning that it is subject to change and is a work-in-progress.

 The key abilities of the password policy overlay are as follows:

     Enforce a minimum length for new passwords
     Make sure passwords are not changed too frequently
     Cause passwords to expire, provide warnings before they need to be changed, and allow a fixed number of 'grace' logins to allow them to be changed after they have expired
     Maintain a history of passwords to prevent password re-use
     Prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures
     Force a password to be changed at the next authentication
     Set an administrative lock on an account
     Support multiple password policies on a default or a per-object basis.
     Perform arbitrary quality checks using an external loadable module. This is a non-standard extension of the draft RFC.

 12.10.2. Password Policy Configuration

 Instantiate the module in the database where it will be used, after adding the new ppolicy schema and loading the ppolicy module. The following example shows the ppolicy module being added to the database that handles the naming context "dc=example,dc=com". In this example we are also specifying the DN of a policy object to use if none other is specified in a user's object.

        database bdb
        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
        [...additional database configuration directives go here...]
    
        overlay ppolicy
        ppolicy_default "cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com"

 Now we need a container for the policy objects. In our example the password policy objects are going to be placed in a section of the tree called "ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com":

        dn: ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: organizationalUnit
        objectClass: top
        ou: policies

 The default policy object that we are creating defines the following policies:

     The user is allowed to change his own password. Note that the directory ACLs for this attribute can also affect this ability (pwdAllowUserChange: TRUE).
     The name of the password attribute is "userPassword" (pwdAttribute: userPassword). Note that this is the only value that is accepted by OpenLDAP for this attribute.
     The server will check the syntax of the password. If the server is unable to check the syntax (i.e., it was hashed or otherwise encoded by the client) it will return an error refusing the password (pwdCheckQuality: 2).
     When a client includes the Password Policy Request control with a bind request, the server will respond with a password expiration warning if it is going to expire in ten minutes or less (pwdExpireWarning: 600). The warnings themselves are returned in a Password Policy Response control.
     When the password for a DN has expired, the server will allow five additional "grace" logins (pwdGraceAuthNLimit: 5).
     The server will maintain a history of the last five passwords that were used for a DN (pwdInHistory: 5).
     The server will lock the account after the maximum number of failed bind attempts has been exceeded (pwdLockout: TRUE).
     When the server has locked an account, the server will keep it locked until an administrator unlocks it (pwdLockoutDuration: 0)
     The server will reset its failed bind count after a period of 30 seconds.
     Passwords will not expire (pwdMaxAge: 0).
     Passwords can be changed as often as desired (pwdMinAge: 0).
     Passwords must be at least 5 characters in length (pwdMinLength: 5).
     The password does not need to be changed at the first bind or when the administrator has reset the password (pwdMustChange: FALSE)
     The current password does not need to be included with password change requests (pwdSafeModify: FALSE)
     The server will only allow five failed binds in a row for a particular DN (pwdMaxFailure: 5).

 The actual policy would be:

        dn: cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: default
        objectClass: pwdPolicy
        objectClass: person
        objectClass: top
        pwdAllowUserChange: TRUE
        pwdAttribute: userPassword
        pwdCheckQuality: 2
        pwdExpireWarning: 600
        pwdFailureCountInterval: 30
        pwdGraceAuthNLimit: 5
        pwdInHistory: 5
        pwdLockout: TRUE
        pwdLockoutDuration: 0
        pwdMaxAge: 0
        pwdMaxFailure: 5
        pwdMinAge: 0
        pwdMinLength: 5
        pwdMustChange: FALSE
        pwdSafeModify: FALSE
        sn: dummy value

 You can create additional policy objects as needed.

 There are two ways password policy can be applied to individual objects:

 1. The pwdPolicySubentry in a user's object - If a user's object has a pwdPolicySubEntry attribute specifying the DN of a policy object, then the policy defined by that object is applied.

 2. Default password policy - If there is no specific pwdPolicySubentry set for an object, and the password policy module was configured with the DN of a default policy object and if that object exists, then the policy defined in that object is applied.

 slapo-ppolicy(5)
 12.11. Referential Integrity
 12.11.1. Overview

 This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to maintain the cohesiveness of a schema which utilizes reference attributes.

 Whenever a modrdn or delete is performed, that is, when an entry's DN is renamed or an entry is removed, the server will search the directory for references to this DN (in selected attributes: see below) and update them accordingly. If it was a delete operation, the reference is deleted. If it was a modrdn operation, then the reference is updated with the new DN.

 For example, a very common administration task is to maintain group membership lists, specially when users are removed from the directory. When an user account is deleted or renamed, all groups this user is a member of have to be updated. LDAP administrators usually have scripts for that. But we can use the refint overlay to automate this task. In this example, if the user is removed from the directory, the overlay will take care to remove the user from all the groups he/she was a member of. No more scripting for this.
 12.11.2. Referential Integrity Configuration

 The configuration for this overlay is as follows:

        overlay refint
        refint_attributes <attribute [attribute ...]>
        refint_nothing <string>
    
     refint_attributes: this parameter specifies a space separated list of attributes which will have the referential integrity maintained. When an entry is removed or has its DN renamed, the server will do an internal search for any of the refint_attributes that point to the affected DN and update them accordingly. IMPORTANT: the attributes listed here must have the distinguishedName syntax, that is, hold DNs as values.
     refint_nothing: some times, while trying to maintain the referential integrity, the server has to remove the last attribute of its kind from an entry. This may be prohibited by the schema: for example, the groupOfNames object class requires at least one member. In these cases, the server will add the attribute value specified in refint_nothing to the entry.

 To illustrate this overlay, we will use the group membership scenario.

 In slapd.conf:

        overlay refint
        refint_attributes member
        refint_nothing "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"

 This configuration tells the overlay to maintain the referential integrity of the member attribute. This attribute is used in the groupOfNames object class which always needs a member, so we add the refint_nothing directive to fill in the group with a standard member should all the members vanish.

 If we have the following group membership, the refint overlay will automatically remove john from the group if his entry is removed from the directory:

 Figure X.Y: Maintaining referential integrity in groups

 Notice that if we rename (modrdn) the john entry to, say, jsmith, the refint overlay will also rename the reference in the member attribute, so the group membership stays correct.

 If we removed all users from the directory who are a member of this group, then the end result would be a single member in the group: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com. This is the refint_nothing parameter kicking into action so that the schema is not violated.

 The rootdn must be set for the database as refint runs as the rootdn to gain access to make its updates. The rootpw does not need to be set.

 12.12. Return Code
 12.12.1. Overview

 This overlay is useful to test the behavior of clients when server-generated erroneous and/or unusual responses occur, for example; error codes, referrals, excessive response times and so on.

 This would be classed as a debugging tool whilst developing client software or additional Overlays.

 For detailed information, please see the slapo-retcode(5) man page.
 12.12.2. Return Code Configuration

 The retcode overlay utilizes the "return code" schema described in the man page. This schema is specifically designed for use with this overlay and is not intended to be used otherwise.

 Note: The necessary schema is loaded automatically by the overlay.

 An example configuration might be:

        overlay         retcode
        retcode-parent  "ou=RetCodes,dc=example,dc=com"
        include         ./retcode.conf
    
        retcode-item    "cn=Unsolicited"                0x00 unsolicited="0"
        retcode-item    "cn=Notice of Disconnect"       0x00 unsolicited="1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20036"
        retcode-item    "cn=Pre-disconnect"             0x34 flags="pre-disconnect"
        retcode-item    "cn=Post-disconnect"            0x34 flags="post-disconnect"

 Note: retcode.conf can be found in the openldap source at: tests/data/retcode.conf

 An excerpt of a retcode.conf would be something like:

 12.13. Rewrite/Remap
 12.13.1. Overview

 It performs basic DN/data rewrite and objectClass/attributeType mapping. Its usage is mostly intended to provide virtual views of existing data either remotely, in conjunction with the proxy backend described in slapd-ldap(5), or locally, in conjunction with the relay backend described in slapd-relay(5).

 This overlay is extremely configurable and advanced, therefore recommended reading is the slapo-rwm(5) man page.

 12.14. Sync Provider
 12.14.1. Overview

 This overlay implements the provider-side support for the LDAP Content Synchronization (RFC4533) as well as syncrepl replication support, including persistent search functionality.
 12.14.2. Sync Provider Configuration

 There is very little configuration needed for this overlay, in fact for many situations merely loading the overlay will suffice.

 However, because the overlay creates a contextCSN attribute in the root entry of the database which is updated for every write operation performed against the database and only updated in memory, it is recommended to configure a checkpoint so that the contextCSN is written into the underlying database to minimize recovery time after an unclean shutdown:

        overlay syncprov
        syncprov-checkpoint 100 10

 For every 100 operations or 10 minutes, which ever is sooner, the contextCSN will be checkpointed.

 The four configuration directives available are syncprov-checkpoint, syncprov-sessionlog, syncprov-nopresent and syncprov-reloadhint which are covered in the man page discussing various other scenarios where this overlay can be used.

 12.15. Translucent Proxy
 12.15.1. Overview

 This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to create a "translucent proxy".

 Entries retrieved from a remote LDAP server may have some or all attributes overridden, or new attributes added, by entries in the local database before being presented to the client.

 A search operation is first populated with entries from the remote LDAP server, the attributes of which are then overridden with any attributes defined in the local database. Local overrides may be populated with the add, modify, and modrdn operations, the use of which is restricted to the root user of the translucent local database.

 A compare operation will perform a comparison with attributes defined in the local database record (if any) before any comparison is made with data in the remote database.
 12.15.2. Translucent Proxy Configuration

 There are various options available with this overlay, but for this example we will demonstrate adding new attributes to a remote entry and also searching against these newly added local attributes. For more information about overriding remote entries and search configuration, please see slapo-translucent(5)

 Note: The Translucent Proxy overlay will disable schema checking in the local database, so that an entry consisting of overlay attributes need not adhere to the complete schema.

 First we configure the overlay in the normal manner:

        include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
        include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
        include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
    
        pidfile     ./slapd.pid
        argsfile    ./slapd.args
    
        database    bdb
        suffix      "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn      "cn=trans,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootpw      secret
        directory   ./openldap-data
    
        index       objectClass eq
    
        overlay     translucent
        translucent_local carLicense
    
        uri         ldap://192.168.X.X:389
        lastmod     off
        acl-bind    binddn="cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" credentials="blahblah"

 You will notice the overlay directive and a directive to say what attribute we want to be able to search against in the local database. We must also load the ldap backend which will connect to the remote directory server.

 Now we take an example LDAP group:

        # itsupport, Groups, suretecsystems.com
        dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: posixGroup
        objectClass: sambaGroupMapping
        cn: itsupport
        gidNumber: 1000
        sambaSID: S-1-5-21-XXX
        sambaGroupType: 2
        displayName: itsupport
        memberUid: ghenry
        memberUid: joebloggs

 and create an LDIF file we can use to add our data to the local database, using some pretty strange choices of new attributes for demonstration purposes:

        [ghenry@suretec test_configs]$ cat test-translucent-add.ldif
        dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        businessCategory: frontend-override
        carLicense: LIVID
        employeeType: special
        departmentNumber: 9999999
        roomNumber: 41L-535

 Searching against the proxy gives:

        [ghenry@suretec test_configs]$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:9001 "(cn=itsupport)"
        # itsupport, Groups, OxObjects, suretecsystems.com
        dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: posixGroup
        objectClass: sambaGroupMapping
        cn: itsupport
        gidNumber: 1003
        SAMBASID: S-1-5-21-XXX
        SAMBAGROUPTYPE: 2
        displayName: itsupport
        memberUid: ghenry
        memberUid: joebloggs
        roomNumber: 41L-535
        departmentNumber: 9999999
        employeeType: special
        carLicense: LIVID
        businessCategory: frontend-override

 Here we can see that the 5 new attributes are added to the remote entry before being returned to the our client.

 Because we have configured a local attribute to search against:

        overlay     translucent
        translucent_local carLicense

 we can also search for that to return the completely fabricated entry:

        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:9001 (carLicense=LIVID)

 This is an extremely feature because you can then extend a remote directory server locally and also search against the local entries.

 Note: Because the translucent overlay does not perform any DN rewrites, the local and remote database instances must have the same suffix. Other configurations will probably fail with No Such Object and other errors

 12.16. Attribute Uniqueness
 12.16.1. Overview

 This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to enforce the uniqueness of some or all attributes within a subtree.
 12.16.2. Attribute Uniqueness Configuration

 This overlay is only effective on new data from the point the overlay is enabled. To check uniqueness for existing data, you can export and import your data again via the LDAP Add operation, which will not be suitable for large amounts of data, unlike slapcat.

 For the following example, if uniqueness were enforced for the mail attribute, the subtree would be searched for any other records which also have a mail attribute containing the same value presented with an add, modify or modrdn operation which are unique within the configured scope. If any are found, the request is rejected.

 Note: If no attributes are specified, for example ldap:///??sub?, then the URI applies to all non-operational attributes. However, the keyword ignore can be specified to exclude certain non-operational attributes.

 To search at the base dn of the current backend database ensuring uniqueness of the mail attribute, we simply add the following configuration:

        overlay unique
        unique_uri ldap:///?mail?sub?

 For an existing entry of:

        dn: cn=gavin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: top
        objectClass: inetorgperson
        cn: gavin
        sn: henry
        mail: ghenry@suretecsystems.com

 and we then try to add a new entry of:

        dn: cn=robert,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: top
        objectClass: inetorgperson
        cn: robert
        sn: jones
        mail: ghenry@suretecsystems.com

 would result in an error like so:

        adding new entry "cn=robert,dc=example,dc=com"
        ldap_add: Constraint violation (19)
                additional info: some attributes not unique

 The overlay can have multiple URIs specified within a domain, allowing complex selections of objects and also have multiple unique_uri statements or olcUniqueURI attributes which will create independent domains.

 For more information and details about the strict and ignore keywords, please see the slapo-unique(5) man page.

 12.17. Value Sorting
 12.17.1. Overview

 The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a backend database to sort the values of specific multi-valued attributes within a subtree. The sorting occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search response.
 12.17.2. Value Sorting Configuration

 Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using either numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a "weighted" sort can be specified, which uses a numeric weight prepended to the attribute values.

 The weighted sort is always performed in ascending order, but may be combined with the other methods for values that all have equal weights. The weight is specified by prepending an integer weight {<weight>} in front of each value of the attribute for which weighted sorting is desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and never returned in search results.

 Here are a few examples:

        loglevel    sync stats
    
        database    hdb
        suffix      "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        directory   /usr/local/var/openldap-data
    
        ......
    
        overlay valsort
        valsort-attr memberUid ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com alpha-ascend

 For example, ascend:

        # sharedemail, Groups, suretecsystems.com
        dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: posixGroup
        objectClass: top
        cn: sharedemail
        gidNumber: 517
        memberUid: admin
        memberUid: dovecot
        memberUid: laura
        memberUid: suretec

 For weighted, we change our data to:

        # sharedemail, Groups, suretecsystems.com
        dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: posixGroup
        objectClass: top
        cn: sharedemail
        gidNumber: 517
        memberUid: {4}admin
        memberUid: {2}dovecot
        memberUid: {1}laura
        memberUid: {3}suretec

 and change the config to:

        overlay valsort
        valsort-attr memberUid ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com weighted

 Searching now results in:

        # sharedemail, Groups, OxObjects, suretecsystems.com
        dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        objectClass: posixGroup
        objectClass: top
        cn: sharedemail
        gidNumber: 517
        memberUid: laura
        memberUid: dovecot
        memberUid: suretec
        memberUid: admin

 12.18. Overlay Stacking
 12.18.1. Overview

 Overlays can be stacked, which means that more than one overlay can be instantiated for each database, or for the frontend. As a consequence, each overlays function is called, if defined, when overlay execution is invoked. Multiple overlays are executed in reverse order (as a stack) with respect to their definition in slapd.conf (5), or with respect to their ordering in the config database, as documented in slapd-config (5).

 13. Schema Specification

 This chapter describes how to extend the user schema used by slapd(8). The chapter assumes the reader is familiar with the LDAP/X.500 information model.

 The first section, Distributed Schema Files details optional schema definitions provided in the distribution and where to obtain other definitions. The second section, Extending Schema, details how to define new schema items.

 This chapter does not discuss how to extend system schema used by slapd(8) as this requires source code modification. System schema includes all operational attribute types or any object class which allows or requires an operational attribute (directly or indirectly).
 13.1. Distributed Schema Files

 OpenLDAP Software is distributed with a set of schema specifications for your use. Each set is defined in a file suitable for inclusion (using the include directive) in your slapd.conf(5) file. These schema files are normally installed in the /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema directory.
 Table 8.1: Provided Schema Specifications File 	Description
 core.schema 	OpenLDAP core (required)
 cosine.schema 	Cosine and Internet X.500 (useful)
 inetorgperson.schema 	InetOrgPerson (useful)
 misc.schema 	Assorted (experimental)
 nis.schema 	Network Information Services (FYI)
 openldap.schema 	OpenLDAP Project (experimental)

 To use any of these schema files, you only need to include the desired file in the global definitions portion of your slapd.conf(5) file. For example:

         # include schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema

 Additional files may be available. Please consult the OpenLDAP FAQ (http://www.openldap.org/faq/).

 Note: You should not modify any of the schema items defined in provided files.

 13.2. Extending Schema

 Schema used by slapd(8) may be extended to support additional syntaxes, matching rules, attribute types, and object classes. This chapter details how to add user application attribute types and object classes using the syntaxes and matching rules already supported by slapd. slapd can also be extended to support additional syntaxes, matching rules and system schema, but this requires some programming and hence is not discussed here.

 There are five steps to defining new schema:

     obtain Object Identifier
     choose a name prefix
     create local schema file
     define custom attribute types (if necessary)
     define custom object classes

 13.2.1. Object Identifiers

 Each schema element is identified by a globally unique Object Identifier (OID). OIDs are also used to identify other objects. They are commonly found in protocols described by ASN.1. In particular, they are heavily used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). As OIDs are hierarchical, your organization can obtain one OID and branch it as needed. For example, if your organization were assigned OID 1.1, you could branch the tree as follows:
 Table 8.2: Example OID hierarchy OID 	Assignment
 1.1 	Organization's OID
 1.1.1 	SNMP Elements
 1.1.2 	LDAP Elements
 1.1.2.1 	AttributeTypes
 1.1.2.1.1 	x-my-Attribute
 1.1.2.2 	ObjectClasses
 1.1.2.2.1 	x-my-ObjectClass

 You are, of course, free to design a hierarchy suitable to your organizational needs under your organization's OID. No matter what hierarchy you choose, you should maintain a registry of assignments you make. This can be a simple flat file or something more sophisticated such as the OpenLDAP OID Registry (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=197).

 For more information about Object Identifiers (and a listing service) see http://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/.

     Under no circumstances should you hijack OID namespace!

 To obtain a registered OID at no cost, apply for a OID under the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (ORG:IANA) maintained Private Enterprise arc. Any private enterprise (organization) may request a Private Enterprise Number (PEN) to be assigned under this arc. Just fill out the IANA form at http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page and your official PEN will be sent to you usually within a few days. Your base OID will be something like 1.3.6.1.4.1.X where X is an integer.

 Note: PENs obtained using this form may be used for any purpose including identifying LDAP schema elements.

 Alternatively, OID name space may be available from a national authority (e.g., ANSI, BSI).
 13.2.2. Naming Elements

 In addition to assigning a unique object identifier to each schema element, you should provide at least one textual name for each element. Names should be registered with the IANA or prefixed with "x-" to place in the "private use" name space.

 The name should be both descriptive and not likely to clash with names of other schema elements. In particular, any name you choose should not clash with present or future Standard Track names (this is assured if you registered names or use names beginning with "x-").

 It is noted that you can obtain your own registered name prefix so as to avoid having to register your names individually. See RFC4520 for details.

 In the examples below, we have used a short prefix 'x-my-'. Such a short prefix would only be suitable for a very large, global organization. In general, we recommend something like 'x-de-Firm-' (German company) or 'x-com-Example' (elements associated with organization associated with example.com).
 13.2.3. Local schema file

 The objectclass and attributeTypes configuration file directives can be used to define schema rules on entries in the directory. It is customary to create a file to contain definitions of your custom schema items. We recommend you create a file local.schema in /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema and then include this file in your slapd.conf(5) file immediately after other schema include directives.

         # include schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
         # include local schema
         include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema

 13.2.4. Attribute Type Specification

 The attributetype directive is used to define a new attribute type. The directive uses the same Attribute Type Description (as defined in RFC4512) used by the attributeTypes attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:

         attributetype <RFC4512 Attribute Type Description>

 where Attribute Type Description is defined by the following ABNF:

       AttributeTypeDescription = "(" whsp
             numericoid whsp              ; AttributeType identifier
           [ "NAME" qdescrs ]             ; name used in AttributeType
           [ "DESC" qdstring ]            ; description
           [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
           [ "SUP" woid ]                 ; derived from this other
                                          ; AttributeType
           [ "EQUALITY" woid              ; Matching Rule name
           [ "ORDERING" woid              ; Matching Rule name
           [ "SUBSTR" woid ]              ; Matching Rule name
           [ "SYNTAX" whsp noidlen whsp ] ; Syntax OID
           [ "SINGLE-VALUE" whsp ]        ; default multi-valued
           [ "COLLECTIVE" whsp ]          ; default not collective
           [ "NO-USER-MODIFICATION" whsp ]; default user modifiable
           [ "USAGE" whsp AttributeUsage ]; default userApplications
           whsp ")"
    
       AttributeUsage =
           "userApplications"     /
           "directoryOperation"   /
           "distributedOperation" / ; DSA-shared
           "dSAOperation"          ; DSA-specific, value depends on server

 where whsp is a space (' '), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. 1.1.0), qdescrs is one or more names, woid is either the name or OID optionally followed by a length specifier (e.g {10}).

 For example, the attribute types name and cn are defined in core.schema as:

         attributeType ( 2.5.4.41 NAME 'name'
                 DESC 'name(s) associated with the object'
                 EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                 SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                 SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{32768} )
         attributeType ( 2.5.4.3 NAME ( 'cn' 'commonName' )
                 DESC 'common name(s) assciated with the object'
                 SUP name )

 Notice that each defines the attribute's OID, provides a short name, and a brief description. Each name is an alias for the OID. slapd(8) returns the first listed name when returning results.

 The first attribute, name, holds values of directoryString (UTF-8 encoded Unicode) syntax. The syntax is specified by OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 identifies the directoryString syntax). A length recommendation of 32768 is specified. Servers should support values of this length, but may support longer values. The field does NOT specify a size constraint, so is ignored on servers (such as slapd) which don't impose such size limits. In addition, the equality and substring matching uses case ignore rules. Below are tables listing commonly used syntax and matching rules (slapd(8) supports these and many more).
 Table 8.3: Commonly Used Syntaxes Name 	OID 	Description
 boolean 	1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 	boolean value
 directoryString 	1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 	Unicode (UTF-8) string
 distinguishedName 	1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 	LDAP DN

 octetString 	1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 	arbitrary octets

 objectIdentiferMatch 	equality 	object identifier

 The second attribute, cn, is a subtype of name hence it inherits the syntax, matching rules, and usage of name. commonName is an alternative name.

 Neither attribute is restricted to a single value. Both are meant for usage by user applications. Neither is obsolete nor collective.

 The following subsections provide a couple of examples.
 13.2.4.1. x-my-UniqueName

 Many organizations maintain a single unique name for each user. Though one could use displayName (RFC2798), this attribute is really meant to be controlled by the user, not the organization. We could just copy the definition of displayName from inetorgperson.schema and replace the OID, name, and description, e.g:

         attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'x-my-UniqueName'
                 DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                 EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                 SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                 SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
                 SINGLE-VALUE )

 However, if we want this name to be used in name assertions, e.g. (name=*Jane*), the attribute could alternatively be defined as a subtype of name, e.g.:

         attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'x-my-UniqueName'
                 DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                 SUP name )

 13.2.4.2. x-my-Photo

 Many organizations maintain a photo of each each user. A x-my-Photo attribute type could be defined to hold a photo. Of course, one could use just use jpegPhoto (RFC2798) (or a subtype) to hold the photo. However, you can only do this if the photo is in JPEG File Interchange Format. Alternatively, an attribute type which uses the Octet String syntax can be defined, e.g.:

         attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.2 NAME 'x-my-Photo'
                 DESC 'a photo (application defined format)'
                 SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40
                 SINGLE-VALUE )

 In this case, the syntax doesn't specify the format of the photo. It's assumed (maybe incorrectly) that all applications accessing this attribute agree on the handling of values.

 If you wanted to support multiple photo formats, you could define a separate attribute type for each format, prefix the photo with some typing information, or describe the value using ASN.1 and use the ;binary transfer option.

 Another alternative is for the attribute to hold a URI pointing to the photo. You can model such an attribute after labeledURI (RFC2079) or simply create a subtype, e.g.:

         attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.3 NAME 'x-my-PhotoURI'
                 DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                 SUP labeledURI )

 13.2.5. Object Class Specification

 The objectclasses directive is used to define a new object class. The directive uses the same Object Class Description (as defined in RFC4512) used by the objectClasses attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:

         objectclass <RFC4512 Object Class Description>

 where Object Class Description is defined by the following ABNF:

         ObjectClassDescription = "(" whsp
                 numericoid whsp      ; ObjectClass identifier
                 [ "NAME" qdescrs ]
                 [ "DESC" qdstring ]
                 [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
                 [ "SUP" oids ]       ; Superior ObjectClasses
                 [ ( "ABSTRACT" / "STRUCTURAL" / "AUXILIARY" ) whsp ]
                         ; default structural
                 [ "MUST" oids ]      ; AttributeTypes
                 [ "MAY" oids ]       ; AttributeTypes
                 whsp ")"

 where whsp is a space (' '), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. 1.1.0), qdescrs is one or more names, and oids is one or more names and/or OIDs.
 13.2.5.1. x-my-PhotoObject

 To define an auxiliary object class which allows x-my-Photo to be added to any existing entry.

         objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.1 NAME 'x-my-PhotoObject'
                 DESC 'mixin x-my-Photo'
                 AUXILIARY
                 MAY x-my-Photo )

 13.2.5.2. x-my-Person

 If your organization would like have a private structural object class to instantiate users, you can subclass one of the existing person classes, such as inetOrgPerson (RFC2798), and add any additional attributes which you desire.

         objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.2 NAME 'x-my-Person'
                 DESC 'my person'
                 SUP inetOrgPerson
                 MUST ( x-my-UniqueName $ givenName )
                 MAY x-my-Photo )

 The object class inherits the required/allowed attribute types of inetOrgPerson but requires x-my-UniqueName and givenName and allows x-my-Photo.
 13.2.6. OID Macros

 To ease the management and use of OIDs, slapd(8) supports Object Identifier macros. The objectIdentifier directive is used to equate a macro (name) with a OID. The OID may possibly be derived from a previously defined OID macro. The slapd.conf(5) syntax is:

         objectIdentifier <name> { <oid> | <name>[:<suffix>] }

 The following demonstrates definition of a set of OID macros and their use in defining schema elements:

         objectIdentifier myOID  1.1
         objectIdentifier mySNMP myOID:1
         objectIdentifier myLDAP myOID:2
         objectIdentifier myAttributeType        myLDAP:1
         objectIdentifier myObjectClass  myLDAP:2
         attributetype ( myAttributeType:3 NAME 'x-my-PhotoURI'
                 DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                 SUP labeledURI )
         objectclass ( myObjectClass:1 NAME 'x-my-PhotoObject'
                 DESC 'mixin x-my-Photo'
                 AUXILIARY
                 MAY x-my-Photo )

 14. Security Considerations

 OpenLDAP Software is designed to run in a wide variety of computing environments from tightly-controlled closed networks to the global Internet. Hence, OpenLDAP Software supports many different security mechanisms. This chapter describes these mechanisms and discusses security considerations for using OpenLDAP Software.
 14.1. Network Security
 14.1.1. Selective Listening

 By default, slapd(8) will listen on both the IPv4 and IPv6 "any" addresses. It is often desirable to have slapd listen on select address/port pairs. For example, listening only on the IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 will disallow remote access to the directory server. E.g.:

         slapd -h ldap://127.0.0.1

 While the server can be configured to listen on a particular interface address, this doesn't necessarily restrict access to the server to only those networks accessible via that interface. To selective restrict remote access, it is recommend that an IP Firewall be used to restrict access.

 See Command-line Options and slapd(8) for more information.
 14.1.2. IP Firewall

 IP firewall capabilities of the server system can be used to restrict access based upon the client's IP address and/or network interface used to communicate with the client.

 Generally, slapd(8) listens on port 389/tcp for ldap:// sessions and port 636/tcp for ldaps://) sessions. slapd(8) may be configured to listen on other ports.

 As specifics of how to configure IP firewall are dependent on the particular kind of IP firewall used, no examples are provided here. See the document associated with your IP firewall.
 14.1.3. TCP Wrappers

 slapd(8) supports TCP Wrappers. TCP Wrappers provide a rule-based access control system for controlling TCP/IP access to the server. For example, the host_options(5) rule:

         slapd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 : ALLOW
         slapd: ALL : DENY

 allows only incoming connections from the private network 10.0.0.0 and localhost (127.0.0.1) to access the directory service.

 Note: IP addresses are used as slapd(8) is not normally configured to perform reverse lookups.

 It is noted that TCP wrappers require the connection to be accepted. As significant processing is required just to deny a connection, it is generally advised that IP firewall protection be used instead of TCP wrappers.

 See hosts_access(5) for more information on TCP wrapper rules.
 14.2. Data Integrity and Confidentiality Protection

 Transport Layer Security (TLS) can be used to provide data integrity and confidentiality protection. OpenLDAP supports negotiation of TLS (SSL) via both StartTLS and ldaps://. See the Using TLS chapter for more information. StartTLS is the standard track mechanism.

 A number of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms, such as DIGEST-MD5 and GSSAPI, also provide data integrity and confidentiality protection. See the Using SASL chapter for more information.
 14.2.1. Security Strength Factors

 The server uses Security Strength Factors (SSF) to indicate the relative strength of protection. A SSF of zero (0) indicates no protections are in place. A SSF of one (1) indicates integrity protection are in place. A SSF greater than one (>1) roughly correlates to the effective encryption key length. For example, DES is 56, 3DES is 112, and AES 128, 192, or 256.

 A number of administrative controls rely on SSFs associated with TLS and SASL protection in place on an LDAP session.

 security controls disallow operations when appropriate protections are not in place. For example:

         security ssf=1 update_ssf=112

 requires integrity protection for all operations and encryption protection, 3DES equivalent, for update operations (e.g. add, delete, modify, etc.). See slapd.conf(5) for details.

 For fine-grained control, SSFs may be used in access controls. See the Access Control section for more information.
 14.3. Authentication Methods
 14.3.1. "simple" method

 The LDAP "simple" method has three modes of operation:

     anonymous,
     unauthenticated, and
     user/password authenticated.

 Anonymous access is requested by providing no name and no password to the "simple" bind operation. Unauthenticated access is requested by providing a name but no password. Authenticated access is requested by providing a valid name and password.

 An anonymous bind results in an anonymous authorization association. Anonymous bind mechanism is enabled by default, but can be disabled by specifying "disallow bind_anon" in slapd.conf(5).

 Note: Disabling the anonymous bind mechanism does not prevent anonymous access to the directory. To require authentication to access the directory, one should instead specify "require authc".

 An unauthenticated bind also results in an anonymous authorization association. Unauthenticated bind mechanism is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying "allow bind_anon_cred" in slapd.conf(5). As a number of LDAP applications mistakenly generate unauthenticated bind request when authenticated access was intended (that is, they do not ensure a password was provided), this mechanism should generally remain disabled.

 A successful user/password authenticated bind results in a user authorization identity, the provided name, being associated with the session. User/password authenticated bind is enabled by default. However, as this mechanism itself offers no eavesdropping protection (e.g., the password is set in the clear), it is recommended that it be used only in tightly controlled systems or when the LDAP session is protected by other means (e.g., TLS, IPsec). Where the administrator relies on TLS to protect the password, it is recommended that unprotected authentication be disabled. This is done using the security directive's simple_bind option, which provides fine grain control over the level of confidential protection to require for simple user/password authentication. E.g., using security simple_bind=56 would require simple binds to use encryption of DES equivalent or better.

 The user/password authenticated bind mechanism can be completely disabled by setting "disallow bind_simple".

 Note: An unsuccessful bind always results in the session having an anonymous authorization association.

 14.3.2. SASL method

 The LDAP SASL method allows the use of any SASL authentication mechanism. The Using SASL section discusses the use of SASL.
 14.4. Password Storage

 LDAP passwords are normally stored in the userPassword attribute. RFC4519 specifies that passwords are not stored in encrypted (or hashed) form. This allows a wide range of password-based authentication mechanisms, such as DIGEST-MD5 to be used. This is also the most interoperable storage scheme.

 However, it may be desirable to store a hash of password instead. slapd(8) supports a variety of storage schemes for the administrator to choose from.

 Note: Values of password attributes, regardless of storage scheme used, should be protected as if they were clear text. Hashed passwords are subject to dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks.

 The userPassword attribute is allowed to have more than one value, and it is possible for each value to be stored in a different form. During authentication, slapd will iterate through the values until it finds one that matches the offered password or until it runs out of values to inspect. The storage scheme is stored as a prefix on the value, so a hashed password using the Salted SHA1 (SSHA) scheme looks like:

  userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3

 The advantage of hashed passwords is that an attacker which discovers the hash does not have direct access to the actual password. Unfortunately, as dictionary and brute force attacks are generally quite easy for attackers to successfully mount, this advantage is marginal at best (this is why all modern Unix systems use shadow password files).

 The disadvantages of hashed storage is that they are non-standard, may cause interoperability problem, and generally preclude the use of stronger than Simple (or SASL/PLAIN) password-based authentication mechanisms such as DIGEST-MD5.
 14.4.1. SSHA password storage scheme

 This is the salted version of the SHA scheme. It is believed to be the most secure password storage scheme supported by slapd.

 These values represent the same password:

  userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3
  userPassword: {SSHA}d0Q0626PSH9VUld7yWpR0k6BlpQmtczb

 14.4.2. CRYPT password storage scheme

 This scheme uses the operating system's crypt(3) hash function. It normally produces the traditional Unix-style 13 character hash, but on systems with glibc2 it can also generate the more secure 34-byte MD5 hash.

  userPassword: {CRYPT}aUihad99hmev6
  userPassword: {CRYPT}$1$czBJdDqS$TmkzUAb836oMxg/BmIwN.1

 The advantage of the CRYPT scheme is that passwords can be transferred to or from an existing Unix password file without having to know the cleartext form. Both forms of crypt include salt so they have some resistance to dictionary attacks.

 Note: Since this scheme uses the operating system's crypt(3) hash function, it is therefore operating system specific.

 14.4.3. MD5 password storage scheme

 This scheme simply takes the MD5 hash of the password and stores it in base64 encoded form:

  userPassword: {MD5}Xr4ilOzQ4PCOq3aQ0qbuaQ==

 Although safer than cleartext storage, this is not a very secure scheme. The MD5 algorithm is fast, and because there is no salt the scheme is vulnerable to a dictionary attack.
 14.4.4. SMD5 password storage scheme

 This improves on the basic MD5 scheme by adding salt (random data which means that there are many possible representations of a given plaintext password). For example, both of these values represent the same password:

  userPassword: {SMD5}4QWGWZpj9GCmfuqEvm8HtZhZS6E=
  userPassword: {SMD5}g2/J/7D5EO6+oPdklp5p8YtNFk4=

 14.4.5. SHA password storage scheme

 Like the MD5 scheme, this simply feeds the password through an SHA hash process. SHA is thought to be more secure than MD5, but the lack of salt leaves the scheme exposed to dictionary attacks.

  userPassword: {SHA}5en6G6MezRroT3XKqkdPOmY/BfQ=

 14.4.6. SASL password storage scheme

 This is not really a password storage scheme at all. It uses the value of the userPassword attribute to delegate password verification to another process. See below for more information.

 Note: This is not the same as using SASL to authenticate the LDAP session.

 14.5. Pass-Through authentication

 Since OpenLDAP 2.0 slapd has had the ability to delegate password verification to a separate process. This uses the sasl_checkpass(3) function so it can use any back-end server that Cyrus SASL supports for checking passwords. The choice is very wide, as one option is to use saslauthd(8) which in turn can use local files, Kerberos, an IMAP server, another LDAP server, or anything supported by the PAM mechanism.

 The server must be built with the --enable-spasswd configuration option to enable pass-through authentication.

 Note: This is not the same as using a SASL mechanism to authenticate the LDAP session.

 Pass-Through authentication works only with plaintext passwords, as used in the "simple bind" and "SASL PLAIN" authentication mechanisms.}}

 Pass-Through authentication is selective: it only affects users whose userPassword attribute has a value marked with the "{SASL}" scheme. The format of the attribute is:

  userPassword: {SASL}username@realm

 The username and realm are passed to the SASL authentication mechanism and are used to identify the account whose password is to be verified. This allows arbitrary mapping between entries in OpenLDAP and accounts known to the backend authentication service.

 It would be wise to use access control to prevent users from changing their passwords through LDAP where they have pass-through authentication enabled.
 14.5.1. Configuring slapd to use an authentication provider

 Where an entry has a "{SASL}" password value, OpenLDAP delegates the whole process of validating that entry's password to Cyrus SASL. All the configuration is therefore done in SASL config files.

 The first file to be considered is confusingly named slapd.conf and is typically found in the SASL library directory, often /usr/lib/sasl2/slapd.conf This file governs the use of SASL when talking LDAP to slapd as well as the use of SASL backends for pass-through authentication. See options.html in the Cyrus SASL docs for full details. Here is a simple example for a server that will use saslauthd to verify passwords:

  mech_list: plain
  pwcheck_method: saslauthd
  saslauthd_path: /var/run/sasl2/mux

 14.5.2. Configuring saslauthd

 saslauthd is capable of using many different authentication services: see saslauthd(8) for details. A common requirement is to delegate some or all authentication to another LDAP server. Here is a sample saslauthd.conf that uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD):

  ldap_servers: ldap://dc1.example.com/ ldap://dc2.example.com/

  ldap_search_base: cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
  ldap_filter: (userPrincipalName=%u)

  ldap_bind_dn: cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
  ldap_password: secret

 In this case, saslauthd is run with the ldap authentication mechanism and is set to combine the SASL realm with the login name:

  saslauthd -a ldap -r

 This means that the "username@realm" string from the userPassword attribute ends up being used to search AD for "userPrincipalName=username@realm" - the password is then verified by attempting to bind to AD using the entry found by the search and the password supplied by the LDAP client.
 14.5.3. Testing pass-through authentication

 It is usually best to start with the back-end authentication provider and work through saslauthd and slapd towards the LDAP client.

 In the AD example above, first check that the DN and password that saslauthd will use when it connects to AD are valid:

  ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
       -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
       -w secret \
       -b '' \
       -s base

 Next check that a sample AD user can be found:

  ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
       -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
       -w secret \
       -b cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
       "(userPrincipalName=user@ad.example.com)"

 Check that the user can bind to AD:

  ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
       -D cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
       -w userpassword \
       -b cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
       -s base \
         "(objectclass=*)"

 If all that works then saslauthd should be able to do the same:

  testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p userpassword
  testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p wrongpassword

 Now put the magic token into an entry in OpenLDAP:

  userPassword: {SASL}user@ad.example.com

 It should now be possible to bind to OpenLDAP using the DN of that entry and the password of the AD user.

 15. Using SASL

 OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of authenticating via the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework, which is detailed in RFC4422. This chapter describes how to make use of SASL in OpenLDAP.

 There are several industry standard authentication mechanisms that can be used with SASL, including GSSAPI for Kerberos V, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN and EXTERNAL for use with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

 The standard client tools provided with OpenLDAP Software, such as ldapsearch(1) and ldapmodify(1), will by default attempt to authenticate the user to the LDAP directory server using SASL. Basic authentication service can be set up by the LDAP administrator with a few steps, allowing users to be authenticated to the slapd server as their LDAP entry. With a few extra steps, some users and services can be allowed to exploit SASL's proxy authorization feature, allowing them to authenticate themselves and then switch their identity to that of another user or service.

 This chapter assumes you have read Cyrus SASL for System Administrators, provided with the Cyrus SASL package (in doc/sysadmin.html) and have a working Cyrus SASL installation. You should use the Cyrus SASL sample_client and sample_server to test your SASL installation before attempting to make use of it with OpenLDAP Software.

 Note that in the following text the term user is used to describe a person or application entity who is connecting to the LDAP server via an LDAP client, such as ldapsearch(1). That is, the term user not only applies to both an individual using an LDAP client, but to an application entity which issues LDAP client operations without direct user control. For example, an e-mail server which uses LDAP operations to access information held in an LDAP server is an application entity.
 15.1. SASL Security Considerations

 SASL offers many different authentication mechanisms. This section briefly outlines security considerations.

 Some mechanisms, such as PLAIN and LOGIN, offer no greater security over LDAP simple authentication. Like LDAP simple authentication, such mechanisms should not be used unless you have adequate security protections in place. It is recommended that these mechanisms be used only in conjunction with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Use of PLAIN and LOGIN are not discussed further in this document.

 The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism is the mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism for LDAPv3. Though DIGEST-MD5 is not a strong authentication mechanism in comparison with trusted third party authentication systems (such as Kerberos or public key systems), it does offer significant protections against a number of attacks. Unlike the CRAM-MD5 mechanism, it prevents chosen plaintext attacks. DIGEST-MD5 is favored over the use of plaintext password mechanisms. The CRAM-MD5 mechanism is deprecated in favor of DIGEST-MD5. Use of DIGEST-MD5 is discussed below.

 The GSSAPI mechanism utilizes GSS-API Kerberos V to provide secure authentication services. The KERBEROS_V4 mechanism is available for those using Kerberos IV. Kerberos is viewed as a secure, distributed authentication system suitable for both small and large enterprises. Use of GSSAPI and KERBEROS_V4 are discussed below.

 The EXTERNAL mechanism utilizes authentication services provided by lower level network services such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When used in conjunction with TLS X.509-based public key technology, EXTERNAL offers strong authentication. TLS is discussed in the Using TLS chapter.

 EXTERNAL can also be used with the ldapi:/// transport, as Unix-domain sockets can report the UID and GID of the client process.

 There are other strong authentication mechanisms to choose from, including OTP (one time passwords) and SRP (secure remote passwords). These mechanisms are not discussed in this document.
 15.2. SASL Authentication

 Getting basic SASL authentication running involves a few steps. The first step configures your slapd server environment so that it can communicate with client programs using the security system in place at your site. This usually involves setting up a service key, a public key, or other form of secret. The second step concerns mapping authentication identities to LDAP DN's, which depends on how entries are laid out in your directory. An explanation of the first step will be given in the next section using Kerberos V4 as an example mechanism. The steps necessary for your site's authentication mechanism will be similar, but a guide to every mechanism available under SASL is beyond the scope of this chapter. The second step is described in the section Mapping Authentication Identities.
 15.2.1. GSSAPI

 This section describes the use of the SASL GSSAPI mechanism and Kerberos V with OpenLDAP. It will be assumed that you have Kerberos V deployed, you are familiar with the operation of the system, and that your users are trained in its use. This section also assumes you have familiarized yourself with the use of the GSSAPI mechanism by reading Configuring GSSAPI and Cyrus SASL (provided with Cyrus SASL in the doc/gssapi file) and successfully experimented with the Cyrus provided sample_server and sample_client applications. General information about Kerberos is available at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/.

 To use the GSSAPI mechanism with slapd(8) one must create a service key with a principal for ldap service within the realm for the host on which the service runs. For example, if you run slapd on directory.example.com and your realm is EXAMPLE.COM, you need to create a service key with the principal:

         ldap/directory.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

 When slapd(8) runs, it must have access to this key. This is generally done by placing the key into a keytab file, /etc/krb5.keytab. See your Kerberos and Cyrus SASL documentation for information regarding keytab location settings.

 To use the GSSAPI mechanism to authenticate to the directory, the user obtains a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) prior to running the LDAP client. When using OpenLDAP client tools, the user may mandate use of the GSSAPI mechanism by specifying -Y GSSAPI as a command option.

 For the purposes of authentication and authorization, slapd(8) associates an authentication request DN of the form:

         uid=<primary[/instance]>,cn=<realm>,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

 Continuing our example, a user with the Kerberos principal kurt@EXAMPLE.COM would have the associated DN:

         uid=kurt,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

 and the principal ursula/admin@FOREIGN.REALM would have the associated DN:

         uid=ursula/admin,cn=foreign.realm,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

 The authentication request DN can be used directly ACLs and groupOfNames "member" attributes, since it is of legitimate LDAP DN format. Or alternatively, the authentication DN could be mapped before use. See the section Mapping Authentication Identities for details.
 15.2.2. KERBEROS_V4

 This section describes the use of the SASL KERBEROS_V4 mechanism with OpenLDAP. It will be assumed that you are familiar with the workings of the Kerberos IV security system, and that your site has Kerberos IV deployed. Your users should be familiar with authentication policy, how to receive credentials in a Kerberos ticket cache, and how to refresh expired credentials.

 Note: KERBEROS_V4 and Kerberos IV are deprecated in favor of GSSAPI and Kerberos V.

 Client programs will need to be able to obtain a session key for use when connecting to your LDAP server. This allows the LDAP server to know the identity of the user, and allows the client to know it is connecting to a legitimate server. If encryption layers are to be used, the session key can also be used to help negotiate that option.

 The slapd server runs the service called "ldap", and the server will require a srvtab file with a service key. SASL aware client programs will be obtaining an "ldap" service ticket with the user's ticket granting ticket (TGT), with the instance of the ticket matching the hostname of the OpenLDAP server. For example, if your realm is named EXAMPLE.COM and the slapd server is running on the host named directory.example.com, the /etc/srvtab file on the server will have a service key

         ldap.directory@EXAMPLE.COM

 When an LDAP client is authenticating a user to the directory using the KERBEROS_IV mechanism, it will request a session key for that same principal, either from the ticket cache or by obtaining a new one from the Kerberos server. This will require the TGT to be available and valid in the cache as well. If it is not present or has expired, the client may print out the message:

         ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error

 When the service ticket is obtained, it will be passed to the LDAP server as proof of the user's identity. The server will extract the identity and realm out of the service ticket using SASL library calls, and convert them into an authentication request DN of the form

         uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

 So in our above example, if the user's name were "adamson", the authentication request DN would be:

         uid=adamsom,cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth

 This authentication request DN can be used directly ACLs or, alternatively, mapped prior to use. See the section Mapping Authentication Identities for details.
 15.2.3. DIGEST-MD5

 This section describes the use of the SASL DIGEST-MD5 mechanism using secrets stored either in the directory itself or in Cyrus SASL's own database. DIGEST-MD5 relies on the client and the server sharing a "secret", usually a password. The server generates a challenge and the client a response proving that it knows the shared secret. This is much more secure than simply sending the secret over the wire.

 Cyrus SASL supports several shared-secret mechanisms. To do this, it needs access to the plaintext password (unlike mechanisms which pass plaintext passwords over the wire, where the server can store a hashed version of the password).

 The server's copy of the shared-secret may be stored in Cyrus SASL's own sasldb database, in an external system accessed via saslauthd, or in LDAP database itself. In either case it is very important to apply file access controls and LDAP access controls to prevent exposure of the passwords. The configuration and commands discussed in this section assume the use of Cyrus SASL 2.1.

 To use secrets stored in sasldb, simply add users with the saslpasswd2 command:

        saslpasswd2 -c <username>

 The passwords for such users must be managed with the saslpasswd2 command.

 To use secrets stored in the LDAP directory, place plaintext passwords in the userPassword attribute. It will be necessary to add an option to slapd.conf to make sure that passwords set using the LDAP Password Modify Operation are stored in plaintext:

        password-hash   {CLEARTEXT}

 Passwords stored in this way can be managed either with ldappasswd(1) or by simply modifying the userPassword attribute. Regardless of where the passwords are stored, a mapping will be needed from authentication request DN to user's DN.

 The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism produces authentication IDs of the form:

         uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth

 If the default realm is used, the realm name is omitted from the ID, giving:

         uid=<username>,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth

 See Mapping Authentication Identities below for information on optional mapping of identities.

 With suitable mappings in place, users can specify SASL IDs when performing LDAP operations, and the password stored in sasldb or in the directory itself will be used to verify the authentication. For example, the user identified by the directory entry:

        dn: cn=Andrew Findlay+uid=u000997,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: inetOrgPerson
        objectclass: person
        sn: Findlay
        uid: u000997
        userPassword: secret

 can issue commands of the form:

        ldapsearch -Y DIGEST-MD5 -U u000997 ...

 Note: in each of the above cases, no authorization identity (e.g. -X) was provided. Unless you are attempting SASL Proxy Authorization, no authorization identity should be specified. The server will infer an authorization identity from authentication identity (as described below).

 15.2.4. EXTERNAL

 The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism makes use of an authentication performed by a lower-level protocol: usually TLS or Unix IPC

 Each transport protocol returns Authentication Identities in its own format:
 15.2.4.1. TLS Authentication Identity Format

 This is the Subject DN from the client-side certificate. Note that DNs are displayed differently by LDAP and by X.509, so a certificate issued to

         C=gb, O=The Example Organisation, CN=A Person

 will produce an authentication identity of:

         cn=A Person,o=The Example Organisation,c=gb

 Note that you must set a suitable value for TLSVerifyClient to make the server request the use of a client-side certificate. Without this, the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will not be offered. Refer to the Using TLS chapter for details.
 15.2.4.2. IPC (ldapi:///) Identity Format

 This is formed from the Unix UID and GID of the client process:

         gidNumber=<number>+uidNumber=<number>,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth

 Thus, a client process running as root will be:

         gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth

 15.2.5. Mapping Authentication Identities

 The authentication mechanism in the slapd server will use SASL library calls to obtain the authenticated user's "username", based on whatever underlying authentication mechanism was used. This username is in the namespace of the authentication mechanism, and not in the normal LDAP namespace. As stated in the sections above, that username is reformatted into an authentication request DN of the form

         uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

 or

         uid=<username>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

 depending on whether or not <mechanism> employs the concept of "realms". Note also that the realm part will be omitted if the default realm was used in the authentication.

 The ldapwhoami(1) command may be used to determine the identity associated with the user. It is very useful for determining proper function of mappings.

 It is not intended that you should add LDAP entries of the above form to your LDAP database. Chances are you have an LDAP entry for each of the persons that will be authenticating to LDAP, laid out in your directory tree, and the tree does not start at cn=auth. But if your site has a clear mapping between the "username" and an LDAP entry for the person, you will be able to configure your LDAP server to automatically map a authentication request DN to the user's authentication DN.

 Note: it is not required that the authentication request DN nor the user's authentication DN resulting from the mapping refer to an entry held in the directory. However, additional capabilities become available (see below).

 The LDAP administrator will need to tell the slapd server how to map an authentication request DN to a user's authentication DN. This is done by adding one or more authz-regexp directives to the slapd.conf(5) file. This directive takes two arguments:

         authz-regexp   <search pattern>   <replacement pattern>

 The authentication request DN is compared to the search pattern using the regular expression functions regcomp() and regexec(), and if it matches, it is rewritten as the replacement pattern. If there are multiple authz-regexp directives, only the first whose search pattern matches the authentication identity is used. The string that is output from the replacement pattern should be the authentication DN of the user or an LDAP URL. If replacement string produces a DN, the entry named by this DN need not be held by this server. If the replace string produces an LDAP URL, that LDAP URL must evaluate to one and only one entry held by this server.

 The search pattern can contain any of the regular expression characters listed in regexec(3C). The main characters of note are dot ".", asterisk "*", and the open and close parenthesis "(" and ")". Essentially, the dot matches any character, the asterisk allows zero or more repeats of the immediately preceding character or pattern, and terms in parenthesis are remembered for the replacement pattern.

 The replacement pattern will produce either a DN or URL referring to the user. Anything from the authentication request DN that matched a string in parenthesis in the search pattern is stored in the variable "$1". That variable "$1" can appear in the replacement pattern, and will be replaced by the string from the authentication request DN. If there were multiple sets of parentheses in the search pattern, the variables $2, $3, etc are used.
 15.2.6. Direct Mapping

 Where possible, direct mapping of the authentication request DN to the user's DN is generally recommended. Aside from avoiding the expense of searching for the user's DN, it allows mapping to DNs which refer to entries not held by this server.

 Suppose the authentication request DN is written as:

         uid=adamson,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

 and the user's actual LDAP entry is:

         uid=adamson,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

 then the following authz-regexp directive in slapd.conf(5) would provide for direct mapping.

         authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
           uid=$1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

 An even more lenient rule could be written as

         authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=[^,]*,cn=auth
           uid=$1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

 Be careful about setting the search pattern too leniently, however, since it may mistakenly allow persons to become authenticated as a DN to which they should not have access. It is better to write several strict directives than one lenient directive which has security holes. If there is only one authentication mechanism in place at your site, and zero or one realms in use, you might be able to map between authentication identities and LDAP DN's with a single authz-regexp directive.

 Don't forget to allow for the case where the realm is omitted as well as the case with an explicitly specified realm. This may well require a separate authz-regexp directive for each case, with the explicit-realm entry being listed first.
 15.2.7. Search-based mappings

 There are a number of cases where mapping to a LDAP URL may be appropriate. For instance, some sites may have person objects located in multiple areas of the LDAP tree, such as if there were an ou=accounting tree and an ou=engineering tree, with persons interspersed between them. Or, maybe the desired mapping must be based upon information in the user's information. Consider the need to map the above authentication request DN to user whose entry is as follows:

         dn: cn=Mark Adamson,ou=People,dc=Example,dc=COM
         objectclass: person
         cn: Mark Adamson
         uid: adamson

 The information in the authentication request DN is insufficient to allow the user's DN to be directly derived, instead the user's DN must be searched for. For these situations, a replacement pattern which produces a LDAP URL can be used in the authz-regexp directives. This URL will then be used to perform an internal search of the LDAP database to find the person's authentication DN.

 An LDAP URL, similar to other URL's, is of the form

         ldap://<host>/<base>?<attrs>?<scope>?<filter>

 This contains all of the elements necessary to perform an LDAP search: the name of the server <host>, the LDAP DN search base <base>, the LDAP attributes to retrieve <attrs>, the search scope <scope> which is one of the three options "base", "one", or "sub", and lastly an LDAP search filter <filter>. Since the search is for an LDAP DN within the current server, the <host> portion should be empty. The <attrs> field is also ignored since only the DN is of concern. These two elements are left in the format of the URL to maintain the clarity of what information goes where in the string.

 Suppose that the person in the example from above did in fact have an authentication username of "adamson" and that information was kept in the attribute "uid" in their LDAP entry. The authz-regexp directive might be written as

         authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
           ldap:///ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?(uid=$1)

 This will initiate an internal search of the LDAP database inside the slapd server. If the search returns exactly one entry, it is accepted as being the DN of the user. If there are more than one entries returned, or if there are zero entries returned, the authentication fails and the user's connection is left bound as the authentication request DN.

 The attributes that are used in the search filter <filter> in the URL should be indexed to allow faster searching. If they are not, the authentication step alone can take uncomfortably long periods, and users may assume the server is down.

 A more complex site might have several realms in use, each mapping to a different subtree in the directory. These can be handled with statements of the form:

         # Match Engineering realm
         authz-regexp
            uid=([^,]*),cn=engineering.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
            ldap:///dc=eng,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))
    
         # Match Accounting realm
         authz-regexp
            uid=([^,].*),cn=accounting.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
            ldap:///dc=accounting,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))
    
         # Default realm is customers.example.com
         authz-regexp
            uid=([^,]*),cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
            ldap:///dc=customers,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))

 Note that the explicitly-named realms are handled first, to avoid the realm name becoming part of the UID. Also note the use of scope and filters to limit matching to desirable entries.

 Note as well that authz-regexp internal search are subject to access controls. Specifically, the authentication identity must have auth access.

 See slapd.conf(5) for more detailed information.
 15.3. SASL Proxy Authorization

 The SASL offers a feature known as proxy authorization, which allows an authenticated user to request that they act on the behalf of another user. This step occurs after the user has obtained an authentication DN, and involves sending an authorization identity to the server. The server will then make a decision on whether or not to allow the authorization to occur. If it is allowed, the user's LDAP connection is switched to have a binding DN derived from the authorization identity, and the LDAP session proceeds with the access of the new authorization DN.

 The decision to allow an authorization to proceed depends on the rules and policies of the site where LDAP is running, and thus cannot be made by SASL alone. The SASL library leaves it up to the server to make the decision. The LDAP administrator sets the guidelines of who can authorize to what identity by adding information into the LDAP database entries. By default, the authorization features are disabled, and must be explicitly configured by the LDAP administrator before use.
 15.3.1. Uses of Proxy Authorization

 This sort of service is useful when one entity needs to act on the behalf of many other users. For example, users may be directed to a web page to make changes to their personal information in their LDAP entry. The users authenticate to the web server to establish their identity, but the web server CGI cannot authenticate to the LDAP server as that user to make changes for them. Instead, the web server authenticates itself to the LDAP server as a service identity, say,

         cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com

 and then it will SASL authorize to the DN of the user. Once so authorized, the CGI makes changes to the LDAP entry of the user, and as far as the slapd server can tell for its ACLs, it is the user themself on the other end of the connection. The user could have connected to the LDAP server directly and authenticated as themself, but that would require the user to have more knowledge of LDAP clients, knowledge which the web page provides in an easier format.

 Proxy authorization can also be used to limit access to an account that has greater access to the database. Such an account, perhaps even the root DN specified in slapd.conf(5), can have a strict list of people who can authorize to that DN. Changes to the LDAP database could then be only allowed by that DN, and in order to become that DN, users must first authenticate as one of the persons on the list. This allows for better auditing of who made changes to the LDAP database. If people were allowed to authenticate directly to the privileged account, possibly through the rootpw slapd.conf(5) directive or through a userPassword attribute, then auditing becomes more difficult.

 Note that after a successful proxy authorization, the original authentication DN of the LDAP connection is overwritten by the new DN from the authorization request. If a service program is able to authenticate itself as its own authentication DN and then authorize to other DN's, and it is planning on switching to several different identities during one LDAP session, it will need to authenticate itself each time before authorizing to another DN (or use a different proxy authorization mechanism). The slapd server does not keep record of the service program's ability to switch to other DN's. On authentication mechanisms like Kerberos this will not require multiple connections being made to the Kerberos server, since the user's TGT and "ldap" session key are valid for multiple uses for the several hours of the ticket lifetime.
 15.3.2. SASL Authorization Identities

 The SASL authorization identity is sent to the LDAP server via the -X switch for ldapsearch(1) and other tools, or in the *authzid parameter to the lutil_sasl_defaults() call. The identity can be in one of two forms, either

         u:<username>

 or

         dn:<dn>

 In the first form, the <username> is from the same namespace as the authentication identities above. It is the user's username as it is referred to by the underlying authentication mechanism. Authorization identities of this form are converted into a DN format by the same function that the authentication process used, producing an authorization request DN of the form

         uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

 That authorization request DN is then run through the same authz-regexp process to convert it into a legitimate authorization DN from the database. If it cannot be converted due to a failed search from an LDAP URL, the authorization request fails with "inappropriate access". Otherwise, the DN string is now a legitimate authorization DN ready to undergo approval.

 If the authorization identity was provided in the second form, with a "dn:" prefix, the string after the prefix is already in authorization DN form, ready to undergo approval.
 15.3.3. Proxy Authorization Rules

 Once slapd has the authorization DN, the actual approval process begins. There are two attributes that the LDAP administrator can put into LDAP entries to allow authorization:

         authzTo
         authzFrom

 Both can be multivalued. The authzTo attribute is a source rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the authentication DN to tell what authorization DNs the authenticated DN is allowed to assume. The second attribute is a destination rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the requested authorization DN to tell which authenticated DNs may assume it.

 The choice of which authorization policy attribute to use is up to the administrator. Source rules are checked first in the person's authentication DN entry, and if none of the authzTo rules specify the authorization is permitted, the authzFrom rules in the authorization DN entry are then checked. If neither case specifies that the request be honored, the request is denied. Since the default behavior is to deny authorization requests, rules only specify that a request be allowed; there are no negative rules telling what authorizations to deny.

 The value(s) in the two attributes are of the same form as the output of the replacement pattern of a authz-regexp directive: either a DN or an LDAP URL. For example, if a authzTo value is a DN, that DN is one the authenticated user can authorize to. On the other hand, if the authzTo value is an LDAP URL, the URL is used as an internal search of the LDAP database, and the authenticated user can become ANY DN returned by the search. If an LDAP entry looked like:

         dn: cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com
         authzTo: ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectclass=person)

 then any user who authenticated as cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com could authorize to any other LDAP entry under the search base dc=example,dc=com which has an objectClass of Person.
 15.3.3.1. Notes on Proxy Authorization Rules

 An LDAP URL in a authzTo or authzFrom attribute will return a set of DNs. Each DN returned will be checked. Searches which return a large set can cause the authorization process to take an uncomfortably long time. Also, searches should be performed on attributes that have been indexed by slapd.

 To help produce more sweeping rules for authzFrom and authzTo, the values of these attributes are allowed to be DNs with regular expression characters in them. This means a source rule like

         authzTo: dn.regex:^uid=[^,]*,dc=example,dc=com$

 would allow that authenticated user to authorize to any DN that matches the regular expression pattern given. This regular expression comparison can be evaluated much faster than an LDAP search for (uid=*).

 Also note that the values in an authorization rule must be one of the two forms: an LDAP URL or a DN (with or without regular expression characters). Anything that does not begin with "ldap://" is taken as a DN. It is not permissible to enter another authorization identity of the form "u:<username>" as an authorization rule.
 15.3.3.2. Policy Configuration

 The decision of which type of rules to use, authzFrom or authzTo, will depend on the site's situation. For example, if the set of people who may become a given identity can easily be written as a search filter, then a single destination rule could be written. If the set of people is not easily defined by a search filter, and the set of people is small, it may be better to write a source rule in the entries of each of those people who should be allowed to perform the proxy authorization.

 By default, processing of proxy authorization rules is disabled. The authz-policy directive must be set in the slapd.conf(5) file to enable authorization. This directive can be set to none for no rules (the default), to for source rules, from for destination rules, or both for both source and destination rules.

 Source rules are extremely powerful. If ordinary users have access to write the authzTo attribute in their own entries, then they can write rules that would allow them to authorize as anyone else. As such, when using source rules, the authzTo attribute should be protected with an ACL that only allows privileged users to set its values.

 16. Using TLS

 OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) framework to provide integrity and confidentiality protections and to support LDAP authentication using the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism. TLS is defined in RFC4346.

 Note: For generating certifcates, please reference http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/185.html

 16.1. TLS Certificates

 TLS uses X.509 certificates to carry client and server identities. All servers are required to have valid certificates, whereas client certificates are optional. Clients must have a valid certificate in order to authenticate via SASL EXTERNAL. For more information on creating and managing certificates, see the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or MozNSS documentation, depending on which TLS implementation libraries you are using.
 16.1.1. Server Certificates

 The DN of a server certificate must use the CN attribute to name the server, and the CN must carry the server's fully qualified domain name. Additional alias names and wildcards may be present in the subjectAltName certificate extension. More details on server certificate names are in RFC4513.
 16.1.2. Client Certificates

 The DN of a client certificate can be used directly as an authentication DN. Since X.509 is a part of the X.500 standard and LDAP is also based on X.500, both use the same DN formats and generally the DN in a user's X.509 certificate should be identical to the DN of their LDAP entry. However, sometimes the DNs may not be exactly the same, and so the mapping facility described in Mapping Authentication Identities can be applied to these DNs as well.
 16.2. TLS Configuration

 After obtaining the required certificates, a number of options must be configured on both the client and the server to enable TLS and make use of the certificates. At a minimum, the clients must be configured with the name of the file containing all of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates it will trust. The server must be configured with the CA certificates and also its own server certificate and private key.

 Typically a single CA will have issued the server certificate and all of the trusted client certificates, so the server only needs to trust that one signing CA. However, a client may wish to connect to a variety of secure servers managed by different organizations, with server certificates generated by many different CAs. As such, a client is likely to need a list of many different trusted CAs in its configuration.
 16.2.1. Server Configuration

 The configuration directives for slapd belong in the global directives section of slapd.conf(5).
 16.2.1.1. TLSCACertificateFile <filename>

 This directive specifies the PEM-format file containing certificates for the CA's that slapd will trust. The certificate for the CA that signed the server certificate must be included among these certificates. If the signing CA was not a top-level (root) CA, certificates for the entire sequence of CA's from the signing CA to the top-level CA should be present. Multiple certificates are simply appended to the file; the order is not significant.
 16.2.1.2. TLSCACertificatePath <path>

 This directive specifies the path of a directory that contains individual CA certificates in separate files. In addition, this directory must be specially managed using the OpenSSL c_rehash utility. When using this feature, the OpenSSL library will attempt to locate certificate files based on a hash of their name and serial number. The c_rehash utility is used to generate symbolic links with the hashed names that point to the actual certificate files. As such, this option can only be used with a filesystem that actually supports symbolic links. In general, it is simpler to use the TLSCACertificateFile directive instead.

 When using Mozilla NSS, this directive can be used to specify the path of the directory containing the NSS certificate and key database files. The certutil command can be used to add a CA certificate:

         certutil -d <path> -A -n "name of CA cert" -t CT,, -a -i /path/to/cacertfile.pem
    
     This command will add a CA certficate stored in the PEM (ASCII) formatted
     file named /path/to/cacertfile.pem. -t CT,, means that the certificate is
     trusted to be a CA issuing certs for use in TLS clients and servers.

 16.2.1.3. TLSCertificateFile <filename>

 This directive specifies the file that contains the slapd server certificate. Certificates are generally public information and require no special protection.

 When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified with TLSCACertificatePath), this directive specifies the name of the certificate to use:

        TLSCertificateFile Server-Cert
    
     If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify the
     token name first, followed by a colon:
    
        TLSCertificateFile my hardware device:Server-Cert
    
     Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
    
        certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L

 16.2.1.4. TLSCertificateKeyFile <filename>

 This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the TLSCertificateFile file. Private keys themselves are sensitive data and are usually password encrypted for protection. However, the current implementation doesn't support encrypted keys so the key must not be encrypted and the file itself must be protected carefully.

 When using Mozilla NSS, this directive specifies the name of a file that contains the password for the key for the certificate specified with TLSCertificateFile. The modutil command can be used to turn off password protection for the cert/key database. For example, if TLSCACertificatePath specifes /etc/openldap/certdb as the location of the cert/key database, use modutil to change the password to the empty string:

         modutil -dbdir /etc/openldap/certdb -changepw 'NSS Certificate DB'
    
     You must have the old password, if any. Ignore the WARNING about the running
     browser. Press 'Enter' for the new password.

 16.2.1.5. TLSCipherSuite <cipher-suite-spec>

 This directive configures what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order. <cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher specification for OpenSSL. You can use the command

         openssl ciphers -v ALL

 to obtain a verbose list of available cipher specifications.

 Besides the individual cipher names, the specifiers HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, EXPORT, and EXPORT40 may be helpful, along with TLSv1, SSLv3, and SSLv2.

 To obtain the list of ciphers in GnuTLS use:

         gnutls-cli -l

 When using Mozilla NSS, the OpenSSL cipher suite specifications are used and translated into the format used internally by Mozilla NSS. There isn't an easy way to list the cipher suites from the command line. The authoritative list is in the source code for Mozilla NSS in the file sslinfo.c in the structure

        static const SSLCipherSuiteInfo suiteInfo[]

 16.2.1.6. TLSRandFile <filename>

 This directive specifies the file to obtain random bits from when /dev/urandom is not available. If the system provides /dev/urandom then this option is not needed, otherwise a source of random data must be configured. Some systems (e.g. Linux) provide /dev/urandom by default, while others (e.g. Solaris) require the installation of a patch to provide it, and others may not support it at all. In the latter case, EGD or PRNGD should be installed, and this directive should specify the name of the EGD/PRNGD socket. The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used to specify the filename. Also, in the absence of these options, the .rnd file in the slapd user's home directory may be used if it exists. To use the .rnd file, just create the file and copy a few hundred bytes of arbitrary data into the file. The file is only used to provide a seed for the pseudo-random number generator, and it doesn't need very much data to work.

 This directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
 16.2.1.7. TLSEphemeralDHParamFile <filename>

 This directive specifies the file that contains parameters for Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange. This is required in order to use a DSA certificate on the server side (i.e. TLSCertificateKeyFile points to a DSA key). Multiple sets of parameters can be included in the file; all of them will be processed. Parameters can be generated using the following command

         openssl dhparam [-dsaparam] -out <filename> <numbits>

 This directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
 16.2.1.8. TLSVerifyClient { never | allow | try | demand }

 This directive specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an incoming TLS session, if any. This option is set to never by default, in which case the server never asks the client for a certificate. With a setting of allow the server will ask for a client certificate; if none is provided the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided but the server is unable to verify it, the certificate is ignored and the session proceeds normally, as if no certificate had been provided. With a setting of try the certificate is requested, and if none is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided and it cannot be verified, the session is immediately terminated. With a setting of demand the certificate is requested and a valid certificate must be provided, otherwise the session is immediately terminated.

 Note: The server must request a client certificate in order to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a TLS session. As such, a non-default TLSVerifyClient setting must be configured before SASL EXTERNAL authentication may be attempted, and the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will only be offered to the client if a valid client certificate was received.

 16.2.2. Client Configuration

 Most of the client configuration directives parallel the server directives. The names of the directives are different, and they go into ldap.conf(5) instead of slapd.conf(5), but their functionality is mostly the same. Also, while most of these options may be configured on a system-wide basis, they may all be overridden by individual users in their .ldaprc files.

 The LDAP Start TLS operation is used in LDAP to initiate TLS negotiation. All OpenLDAP command line tools support a -Z and -ZZ flag to indicate whether a Start TLS operation is to be issued. The latter flag indicates that the tool is to cease processing if TLS cannot be started while the former allows the command to continue.

 In LDAPv2 environments, TLS is normally started using the LDAP Secure URI scheme (ldaps://) instead of the normal LDAP URI scheme (ldap://). OpenLDAP command line tools allow either scheme to used with the -H flag and with the URI ldap.conf(5) option.
 16.2.2.1. TLS_CACERT <filename>

 This is equivalent to the server's TLSCACertificateFile option. As noted in the TLS Configuration section, a client typically may need to know about more CAs than a server, but otherwise the same considerations apply.
 16.2.2.2. TLS_CACERTDIR <path>

 This is equivalent to the server's TLSCACertificatePath option. The specified directory must be managed with the OpenSSL c_rehash utility as well. If using Mozilla NSS, <path> may contain a cert/key database.
 16.2.2.3. TLS_CERT <filename>

 This directive specifies the file that contains the client certificate. This is a user-only directive and can only be specified in a user's .ldaprc file.

 When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified with TLS_CACERTDIR), this directive specifies the name of the certificate to use:

        TLS_CERT Certificate for Sam Carter
    
     If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify the
     token name first, followed by a colon:
    
        TLS_CERT my hardware device:Certificate for Sam Carter
    
     Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
    
        certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L

 16.2.2.4. TLS_KEY <filename>

 This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the TLS_CERT file. The same constraints mentioned for TLSCertificateKeyFile apply here. This is also a user-only directive.
 16.2.2.5. TLS_RANDFILE <filename>

 This directive is the same as the server's TLSRandFile option.
 16.2.2.6. TLS_REQCERT { never | allow | try | demand }

 This directive is equivalent to the server's TLSVerifyClient option. However, for clients the default value is demand and there generally is no good reason to change this setting.

 17. Constructing a Distributed Directory Service

 For many sites, running one or more slapd(8) that hold an entire subtree of data is sufficient. But often it is desirable to have one slapd refer to other directory services for a certain part of the tree (which may or may not be running slapd).

 slapd supports subordinate and superior knowledge information. Subordinate knowledge information is held in referral objects (RFC3296).
 17.1. Subordinate Knowledge Information

 Subordinate knowledge information may be provided to delegate a subtree. Subordinate knowledge information is maintained in the directory as a special referral object at the delegate point. The referral object acts as a delegation point, gluing two services together. This mechanism allows for hierarchical directory services to be constructed.

 A referral object has a structural object class of referral and has the same Distinguished Name as the delegated subtree. Generally, the referral object will also provide the auxiliary object class extensibleObject. This allows the entry to contain appropriate Relative Distinguished Name values. This is best demonstrated by example.

 If the server a.example.net holds dc=example,dc=net and wished to delegate the subtree ou=subtree,dc=example,dc=net to another server b.example.net, the following named referral object would be added to a.example.net:

         dn: dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=net
         objectClass: referral
         objectClass: extensibleObject
         dc: subtree
         ref: ldap://b.example.net/dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=net

 The server uses this information to generate referrals and search continuations to subordinate servers.

 For those familiar with X.500, a named referral object is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a subr DSE.
 17.2. Superior Knowledge Information

 Superior knowledge information may be specified using the referral directive. The value is a list of URIs referring to superior directory services. For servers without immediate superiors, such as for a.example.net in the example above, the server can be configured to use a directory service with global knowledge, such as the OpenLDAP Root Service (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=393).

         referral        ldap://root.openldap.org/

 However, as a.example.net is the immediate superior to b.example.net, b.example.net would be configured as follows:

         referral        ldap://a.example.net/

 The server uses this information to generate referrals for operations acting upon entries not within or subordinate to any of the naming contexts held by the server.

 For those familiar with X.500, this use of the ref attribute is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a Supr DSE.
 17.3. The ManageDsaIT Control

 Adding, modifying, and deleting referral objects is generally done using ldapmodify(1) or similar tools which support the ManageDsaIT control. The ManageDsaIT control informs the server that you intend to manage the referral object as a regular entry. This keeps the server from sending a referral result for requests which interrogate or update referral objects.

 The ManageDsaIT control should not be specified when managing regular entries.

 The -M option of ldapmodify(1) (and other tools) enables ManageDsaIT. For example:

         ldapmodify -M -f referral.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=net" -W

 or with ldapsearch(1):

         ldapsearch -M -b "dc=example,dc=net" -x "(objectclass=referral)" '*' ref

 Note: the ref attribute is operational and must be explicitly requested when desired in search results.

 Note: the use of referrals to construct a Distributed Directory Service is extremely clumsy and not well supported by common clients. If an existing installation has already been built using referrals, the use of the chain overlay to hide the referrals will greatly improve the usability of the Directory system. A better approach would be to use explicitly defined local and proxy databases in subordinate configurations to provide a seamless view of the Distributed Directory.

 Note: LDAP operations, even subtree searches, normally access only one database. That can be changed by gluing databases together with the subordinate/olcSubordinate keyword. Please see slapd.conf(5) and slapd-config(5).


## 复制技术

LDAP同步复制

LDAP同步复制引擎, 简称syncrepl, 是一个消费方的复制引擎，能让消费者服务器维护一个抽取片断的影子副本. 一个syncrepl引擎以slapd的一个线程的方式驻留在消费者那里. 它建立和维护一个消费者复制，方法是连接一个复制提供者去执行初始化DIT内容载荷以及接下来的定期的内容拉取或及时根据内容变更来更新。
Syncrepl 使用LDAP内容同步协议(或简称 LDAP Sync) 作为复制同步协议. LDAP Sync 提供一个有状态的复制，它同时支持拉模式和推模式同步并且不要求使用历史存储. 在拉模式复制下消费者定期拉提供者服务器的内容来更新. 在推模式复制下消费者监听提供者实时发送的更新. 因为协议不要求历史存储, 提供者不需要维护任何它接收到的更新的日志. (注意syncrepl引擎是可扩展的，并支持未来新增的复制协议.)
Syncrepl通过维护和交换同步cookies来保持对复制内容的状态的跟踪. 因为syncrepl消费者和提供者维护它们的内容状态, 消费者可以拉取提供者的内容来执行增量同步，只要请求那些最新的提供者内容条目。 Syncrepl也通过维护复制状态方便了复制的管理. 消费者复制可以在任何同步状态下从一个消费方或一个提供方的备份来构建. Syncrepl能自动重新同步消费者复制到和当前的提供者内容一致的最新状态.
Syncrepl同时支持拉模式和推模式同步. 在它的基本的 refreshOnly 同步模式下, 提供者使用基于拉模式的同步,这里消费者服务器不需要被跟踪并且不维护历史信息. 需要提供者处理的定期的拉请求信息，包含在请求本身的同步cookie里面。为了优化基于拉模式的同步, syncrepl把LDAP同步协议的当前阶段当成它的删除阶段一样处理, 而不是频繁地回滚完全重载. 为了更好地优化基于拉模式的同步, 提供者可以维护一个按范围划分的会话日志作为历史存储. 在它的 refreshAndPersist 同步模式, 提供者使用基于推模式的同步. 提供者维护对请求了一个持久性搜索的消费者服务器的跟踪，并且当提供者复制内容修改的时候向它们发送必要的更新.
有了syncrepl, 如果消费者服务器有对被复制的DIT片断的适当的操作权限，一个消费者服务器可以建立一个复制而不修改提供者的配置并且不需要重新启动提供者服务器. 消费者服务器可以停止复制，也不需要提供方的任何变更和重启.
Syncrepl支持局部的，稀疏的和片断复制. 影子DIT片断由一个标准通用搜索来定义，包括基础，范围，过滤条件，和属性列表. 复制内容也受限于syncrepl复制连接的绑定用户的操作权限.
LDAP内容同步协议

LDAP同步协议允许一个客户端维护DIT片段的一个同步副本。LDAP同步操作的定义是一套控制,以及扩展LDAP搜索操作的其它协议元素。本节仅简单介绍LDAP内容同步协议。欲了解更多信息，请参阅RFC4533 。
LDAP同步协议支持拉和监听变更，通过定义两个各不相同的同步操作： refreshOnly和refreshAndPersist 。拉是由refreshOnly操作实现的。消费者使用一个LDAP搜索请求拉提供者，附带LDAP同步控制。消费者副本通过使用传回搜索到的信息实现拉 取， 来从供应商副本同步。提供者在正常搜索时，搜索行动结束返回SearchResultDone，来表示完成搜索。监听是由 refreshAndPersist操作实施的。顾名思义，它首先是一个搜索，如refreshOnly 。不是在返回所有目前搜索条件相匹配的条目后就完成搜索，而是同步搜索仍然保持供应商的持久化。随后供应商的同步内容更新产生额外的条目更新发送给消费 者。
refreshOnly操作和refreshAndPersist操作的刷新阶段，可以在当前阶段或删除阶段执行。
在当前阶段，提供者发送自上次同步以来搜索范围内更新的条目给消费者。提供者发送更新的条目的所有请求的属性，不论它们改变与否。对于每个 仍然保持不变范围的条目，提供者发送一个当前的消息，只包含条目的名称和代表"当前"状态的同步控制。当前消息不包含条目的任何属性。在消费者收到所有更 新和当前条目之后，它能够可靠地确定新的消费者副本，通过增加那些条目供应商新增的条目，和替换那些供应商修改的条目，并删除消费副本中没有更新过也没有 被提供者指定为"当前"的条目。
更新条目的传播在删除阶段和在当前阶段是一样的。提供者发送搜索范围内自上次同步以来更新的条目的所有请求的属性，给消费者。在删除阶段， 无论如何，供应商为搜索范围内每个删除的条目发送一个删除消息，而不是发送当前消息。删除消息只包含条目的名称代表"删除"状态和同步控制。新的消费副本 的决定可根据附加在SearchResultEntry的同步控制信息来增加，修改和删除条目。
如果LDAP同步提供者维护了一个历史存储，而且可以确定哪些条目的范围超出了自上次同步时间以来的消费者副本，供应商可以使用删除阶段。 如果供应商不保持任何记录存储，无法从历史存储确定范围之外的条目，或存储的历史并不包括消费者的过时的同步状态，供应商应利用当前阶段。比起全部内容重 载产生的同步通信来，使用当前阶段是更有效的。为了更好的减少同步他通讯量，LDAP同步协议还提供了一些优化，如标准化entryUUIDs的传输和一 个单一syncIdSet讯息中传送多种entryUUIDs 。
在refreshOnly同步的结尾，在同步完成之后，提供者发送一个同步cookie到消费者，作为消费者副本的一个状态指标。当消费者向供应商请求下次的增量同步时，它将展示收到的Cookie。
当使用 refreshAndPersist同步时，提供者在刷新阶段的结尾发送一个同步Cookie，通过发送一个同步信息消息refreshDone =为TRUE 。它还发送一个同步的Cookie附加到同步搜索的持久化阶段产生的SearchResultEntry消息中。在持久化阶段，提供者还可以发送一个同步 信息，包含同步的Cookie，在任何提供者要更新消费端状态指标的时候。
在LDAP同步协议，条目具有唯一的entryUUID属性值。它可以作为条目的一个可靠的标识符。条目的DN，另一方面，可随时间变化， 因此不能被视为可靠的标识符。entryUUID附在每个SearchResultEntry或SearchResultReference上作为同步控 制的一个部分。
Syncrepl细节

syncrepl引擎同时使用LDAP同步协议的refreshOnly和refreshAndPersist操作. 如果一个syncrepl规范存在于一个数据库定义中, slapd(8) 以一个 slapd(8) 线程的方式启动一个syncrepl引擎并规划它的执行时间表. 如果指定了refreshOnly操作, syncrepl引擎在一个同步操作完成之后将按间隔时间重新排程. 如果指定了refreshAndPersist操作, 引擎将保持激活并从提供者服务器处理持久性同步消息.
syncrepl引擎同时应用刷新同步的当前阶段和删除阶段. 可以在提供者服务器配置一个会话日志存储一定数量的从数据库中删除的entryUUIDs。多复制共享相同的会话日志. 如果会话日志是当前的并且消费者服务器足够新以至于在客户端的最后一次同步之后没有会话日志条目被删除，那么syncrepl引擎使用删除阶段. 如果没有为复制内容配置会话日志或如果消费者复制太陈旧而无法被会话日志涵盖到, syncrepl引擎使用当前阶段. 目前会话日志存储的设计是基于内存的, 所以包含在会话日志的信息相对多提供者的调用不是持久性的. 目前它不支持通过使用LDAP操作来操作会话日志存储. 它目前也不支持对会话日志施加访问控制.
作为进一步的优化, 甚至同步搜索都不和任何会话日志关联, 当没有发生复制相关的更新时将不会有任何条目传输给消费者.
syncrepl引擎, 是一个消费方的复制引擎, 可以工作在任何后端. LDAP同步提供者可以在任何后端配置成一个 overlay , 但是最好工作在 back-bdb 或 back-hdb 后端.
LDAP同步提供者为每一个数据库维护一个 contextCSN 作为提供者内容的当前同步状态指标. 它是提供者范围的最大 entryCSN，所以对于更小的拥有悬而未决的entryCSN值的条目来说不存在事务. contextCSN不能只是设成最大的已发表的entryCSN，因为 entryCSN 是在一个事务开始之前获得的并且事务还未提交到发表序列.
提供者在context suffix 条目的 contextCSN 属性存储 上下文的contextCSN . 这个属性不是在每个更新操作之后写入数据库; 而是主要在内存中维护. 在数据库启动时间提供者读取最后一次存储的 contextCSN 到内存里并且此后就只使用内存内的拷贝. 缺省的, 对 contextCSN 的变更作为一个数据库更新的结果将不写入数据库，直到服务器完全干净地关机. 如果需要的话，设置一个检查点可以让contextCSN写出得更频繁一些.
注意在启动的时间, 如果提供者不能从suffix条目读取一个 contextCSN , 它将扫描整个数据库来决定它的值, 并且在一个大的数据库中扫描可能要花很长时间. 当一个 contextCSN 值被读取, 这个数据库将仍被扫描用于任何高于它的 entryCSN 值, 以确保 contextCSN 值真的反应了数据库中entryCSN的最大提交 . 在支持不等式索引的数据库中, 在 entryCSN 属性上设置一个 eq 索引并配置 contextCSN 检查点，将极大地加速这个扫描步骤.
如果通过读取和扫描数据库没有决定 contextCSN, 一个新的值将被生成. 而且, 如果扫描数据库产生了一个比之前纪录在suffix条目中的contextCSN属性更大的entryCSN，一个检查点将立刻写入新的值.
消费者也存储它的复制状态, 它是作为一个同步cookie接收的提供者的contextCSN, 在suffix条目的contextCSN属性. 当它执行对提供者服务器的顺序增量同步时,由一个消费者服务器维护的复制状态被用作同步状态指标. 当它在一个级联复制配置中承当一个第二提供者服务器时,它也被用作提供方的同步状态指标. 因为消费者和提供者状态信息是在它们各自的服务器的同一个地方维护的, 任何消费者可以被提拔成为提供者(反之亦然)而不需要任何特别的动作.
因为在syncrepl规范中可能使用一个通用搜索过滤器, 上下文中的一些条目可能被从同步内容中省略了. syncrepl引擎建立一个粘条目来填充复制上下文中的窟窿，如果复制内容的任何部分属于这个窟窿的话。 这些粘条目在搜索结果中将不返回，除非提供了ManageDsaIT控制。
另外，作为在syncrepl规范使用搜索过滤器的结果, 可能会有类似这样的修改，即从复制范围移除一个条目，即使提供者上的条目还没有被删除。逻辑上这个条目必须在消费者服务器被删除但是在 refreshOnly模式下，如果没有会话日志则提供者无法检测和传播这个变更.
关于配置，参见 Syncrepl 节.
部署替代

LDAP同步协议只对复制规定了狭窄的范围, OpenLDAP实现则是极为弹性的并且支持各种操作模式以处理协议中未显式地提出的其他情景.
Delta-syncrepl复制

LDAP同步复制的缺点:
LDAP同步复制是一个基于对象的复制机制. 当提供者的一个被复制对象中的任何属性值改变时, 每个消费者在复制过程中撷取并处理完整的变更对象, 包括所有改变和没改变的属性值. 这方法的一个好处是当多个变更发生在单一对象上时, 那些变更的精确顺序不需要保存; 只有最终状态是有意义的. 但是当使用模式(匹配的方式)在一次变更中处理很多对象时，这个方法可能有缺点。
例如, 假设你有一个数据库包含 100,000 对象，每个对象是 1 KB . 进一步, 假设你经常运行一个批处理工作来变更主服务器上的 100,000 对象的每一个对象中的一个两字节的属性值. 不算LDAP和TCP/IP协议的开销, 每次你运行这个工作每个消费者将传送并处理 1 GB 的数据，只是为了处理这个 200KB 的变更!
在类似这样的案例中，99.98% 被传送和处理的数据将是多余的, 因为它们代表那些未变更的值. 这是一个对宝贵的传输和处理带宽的浪费并且可能导致发展出不可接受的复制日志的积压. 虽然这个情形是一个极端, 但它有助于演示某些LDAP部署的一个非常真实的问题.
看看Delta-syncrepl怎么处理:
Delta-syncrepl, 一个基于变更日志syncrepl变种, 被设计用来处理类似上面所说的情况. Delta-syncrepl通过在提供者一端维护一个可选择深度的变更日志来起作用. 复制消费者为它需要的变更检查这个变更日志，只要变更日志包含它需要的变更，消费者就从变更日志撷取这些变更并把它们应用到自己的数据库. 不过，一个复制（译者注：指变更日志里的变更）如果离上一次同步的状态太远(或消费者根本就是空的), 可以用常规的syncrepl把它（指消费者）恢复到最新的状态然后复制重新切换到delta-syncrepl模式.
关于配置请参考 Delta-syncrepl 章节.
N-Way Multi-Master复制

Multi-Master复制是一个使用Syncrepl复制数据到多个提供者（“主服务器”）目录服务器的复制技术.
对于Multi-Master replication有效的观点

如果任何提供者失败了, 其他提供者将继续接受更新
避免了单点失败
提供者们可以在不同的物理位置例如跨越全球网络.
好的自动容错/高可用性
对于Multi-Master replication无效的观点

(这些经常被声称是Multi-Master复制的优点但是那些说法是错误的):
它不关负载均衡任何事
提供者必须对所有其他的服务器进行写操作，这意味着分布在所有的服务器上的网络交通和写操作负载,和单一主服务器是一样的。
多服务器的服务器利用率和负载在最好的情况下和单服务器一样; 最坏的情况下单服务器更优，因为在提供者和消费者之间使用不同的模式的时候索引可以做出不同的优化调整.
和Multi-Master replication抵触的观点

打破了目录模式的数据一致性的保障
http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1240.html
如果提供者的连接因为网络问题丢失了, 那么 "自动容错" 只会使问题复杂化
通常, 一个特定的机器不能区分失去和一个节点的联系是因为该节点崩溃了还是因为网络连接失败了a
如果一个网络是分割开的而多个客户端开始向每一个"主服务器"写操作，那么和解将是一个痛苦; 可能最好的办法是禁止那些被单一提供者分隔开的客户端的写操作
关于配置，请看下面的 N-Way Multi-Master 章节
MirrorMode复制

MirrorMode是一个混合配置，既提供单主服务器复制的所有一致性保障，也提供多主服务器模式的高可用性. 在 MirrorMode 两个提供者都被设置成从对方复制(就象一个多主服务器配置), 但是一个额外的前段被用来引导所有的写操作到仅仅到两台服务器中的其中一台. 第二个提供者将只在第一台服务器崩溃时进行写操作, 那时这个前端将切换路径引导所有的写操作到第二个提供者. 当一个崩溃的提供者被修复并且重启动后将自动从正在运行的提供者那里活得任何更新并重新同步.
MirrorMode的观点

对于目录的写操作提供了一个高可用性 (HA) 方案(复制处理读操作)
只有一个提供者是可操作的l, 写操作的安全是可接受的
提供者节点从对方互相复制, 所以它们总是最新的并且可以随时准备好接管 (热备份)
Syncrepl也允许提供者节点在任何停机时间进行重新同步
和MirrorMode抵触的观点

MirrorMode 不能被称为多主机方案. 这是因为同一时间写操作不得不仅限于镜像节点中的一个
MirrorMode 可被称为Active-Active Hot-Standby（“双活热备份”,呃，这个翻译怎么样，传神不？）, 因此需要一个额外的服务器(代理模式的slapd)或设备(硬件负载平衡装置)来管理哪个提供者是当前激活的
备份的管理稍微不同
如果备份bdb本身并且定期备份事务日志文件，那么镜像对的相同数字需要用于收集日志文件直到下一次数据库备份发生
为了确保所有数据库都是一致的, 当执行一个slapcat的时候每个数据库可能都不得不置于只读模式.
Delta-Syncrepl扔不支持
关于配置，请看下面的 MirrorMode 章节
Syncrepl代理模式

因为LDAP同步协议同时支持基于“拉”和“推”的复制, “推”模式 (refreshAndPersist) 在提供者开始"推"变更之前仍必须由消费者初始化. 在一些网络配置中, 特别是防火墙限制了连接的方向时, 一个提供者初始化的推模式是需要的.
这个模式可以被配置成LDAP Backend (Backends and slapd-ldap(8)). 不用在实际的消费者服务器上运行syncrepl引擎, 而是一个slapd-ldap代理设置在靠近（或搭配在）提供者的地方指向消费者, 而这个syncrepl引擎运行在这个代理服务器上.
关于配置, 请看 Syncrepl代理 章节.
替代Slurpd

旧的slurpd机制只操作主服务器初始化的推模式. Slurpd复制被Syncrepl复制取代了并且在OpenLDAP 2.4中被完全移除了.
slurpd守护进程是原来继承自UMich's LDAP的复制机制并且以推模式操作: 主服务器推变更到从服务器. 因为多种原因它被替换掉, 简短的说:
它是不可靠的
它对replog中的记录的次序极为敏感
它可能很容易失去同步, 这时需要手工干预来从主目录重新同步从服务器数据库
它对不可用的服务器不是非常宽容. 如果一个从服务器长时间停机, replog可能变得太大以至于slurpd无法处理
它只工作在推模式
它需要停止和重新启动主服务器来增加从服务器
它只支持单一主服务器复制
Syncrepl没有那些弱点:
Syncrepl是自同步的; 你可以在任何状态启动一个消费者数据库，从完全空的到完全同步的，它将自动做正确的事来完成和维护同步
它对变更发生的次序完全不敏感
它保障消费者和提供者内容的合流,不用手工干预
无论一个消费者多长时间没有联系提供者，它都能重新同步
Syncrepl能双向操作
消费者能在不用碰提供者的情况下被加入
支持多主服务器复制
配置不同的复制类型

Syncrepl

Syncrepl配置

因为syncrepl是一个消费方的复制引擎, syncrepl规范定义在 slapd.conf(5) 的消费者服务器, 而不是在提供者的服务器配置文件里. 复制内容的初始化装载可以有两种执行方式，以无同步cookie的方式启动一个syncrepl 引擎，或装载一个提供者服务器的全备份LDIF文件填充到消费者服务器.
当从一个备份装载的时候, 它不需要执行从提供者内容的最新备份初始化装载这个动作. syncrepl引擎将自动同步初始化的消费者复制当前的提供者内容. 结果是, 它不需要为了避免由于内容备份和装载过程中提供者服务器仍在更新而导致复制不一致的问题来停止提供者服务器.
当复制一个大规模的目录时, 特别是在一个带宽受限的环境, 建议从备份装载消费者而不是使用syncrepl执行一个完全的初始化装载.
设置提供者的slapd

提供者被实现为一个 overlay, 所以这个 overlay 本身在使用之前必须首先如 slapd.conf(5) 配置. 提供者只有两个配置指示, 在 contextCSN 上设定检查点和配置会话日志. 因为 LDAP 同步搜索受限于访问控制, 应为复制的内容设置正确的访问控制权限.
contextCSN检查点设置如下
        syncprov-checkpoint <ops> <minutes>
检查点只在成功的写操作之后测试. 如果 <ops> 操作了或从上次检查点到现在超过了 <minutes> 时间, 将执行一个新的检查点.
会话日志设置如下
        syncprov-sessionlog <size>
这里 <size> 是会话日志可以记录的条目的最大数量. 当一个会话日志被配置好, 它就自动用于所有对此数据库的 LDAP 同步搜索.
注意使用会话日志需要搜索 entryUUID 属性. 在这个属性上设一个 eq 索引将极有益于提供者服务器的会话日志的性能.
slapd.conf(5)中一个更复杂的例子内容如下:
        database bdb
        suffix dc=Example,dc=com
        rootdn dc=Example,dc=com
        directory /var/ldap/db
        index objectclass,entryCSN,entryUUID eq

        overlay syncprov
        syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
        syncprov-sessionlog 100
设置消费者的slapd

在 slapd.conf(5) 的replica范围的数据库一节定义了syncrepl复制. syncrepl引擎是独立的后端并且可以使用任何数据库类型定义directive.
        database hdb
        suffix dc=Example,dc=com
        rootdn dc=Example,dc=com
        directory /var/ldap/db
        index objectclass,entryCSN,entryUUID eq

        syncrepl rid=123
                provider=ldap://provider.example.com:389
                type=refreshOnly
                interval=01:00:00:00
                searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                filter="(objectClass=organizationalPerson)"
                scope=sub
                attrs="cn,sn,ou,telephoneNumber,title,l"
                schemachecking=off
                bindmethod=simple
                binddn="cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com"
                credentials=secret
在这个例子中, 消费者将从ldap://provider.example.com的389端口连接到提供者 slapd(8) 来执行每天一次同步的拉操作(refreshOnly)模式. 它将以 cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com 绑定，以密码"secret"进行简单验证. 注意要在提供者服务器为cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com设置适当的访问控制权限以接收想要的复制内容. 另外提供者上的搜索限制必须足够高以允许同步用户接收请求内容完整的拷贝. 消费者使用 rootdn 写入它的数据库所以它总是有全部的权限来写所有的内容.
在上面的例子中同步搜索将在dc=example,dc=com的整个子树搜索 objectClass 是 organizationalPerson 的条目. 请求的属性是 cn, sn, ou, telephoneNumber, title, 和 l. schema 检查被关闭，这样当处理从提供者slapd(8)来的更新时消费者 slapd(8) 将不会强制对条目进行 schema 检查.
更多的详细信息参见 syncrepl 指示, 见本管理指南的slapd配置文件的syncrepl节.
启动提供者和消费者的slapd

提供者slapd(8)不需要重启. contextCSN将会根据需要自动生成: 它可能原来就包含在 LDIF 文件里, 由 slapadd (8) 生成, 在上下文中通过变更生成, 或当第一次 LDAP 同步搜索到达提供者时生成. 如果装载了一个之前不包含contextCSN的LDIF 文件, slapadd (8) 应使用 -w 选项来令它生成. 这将使服务器第一次运行时变得快一点.
当启动一个消费者 slapd(8) 时, 为了从一个特定的状态开始同步，它可能使用命令行参数 -c 即cookie选项，以提供一个同步cookie. cookie是一个逗号分隔的name=value对的列表. 目前支持的 syncrepl cookie 字段是 csn=<csn> 和 rid=<rid>. <csn>代表消费者复制的当前同步状态. <rid> 标识这个消费者服务器的一个本地消费者复制. 它用于把cookie关联到slapd.conf(5)中拥有匹配的复制标识的 syncrepl 定义. <rid>必须超过三位数. 命令行cookie会覆盖存储在消费者复制数据库中的同步cookie.

     # 提交更新到主服务器
     updateref               ldap://ldapmaster.symas.com
以上配置假定你在你用于绑定到提供者的数据库中有一个复制者标识. 另外, 所有数据库 (主数据库, 复制数据库, 以及操作日志存储数据库) 也应该正确调整 DB_CONFIG 文件以满足你的需要.
N-Way Multi-Master

以下例子将使用三个主节点. Keeping in line with test050-syncrepl-multimaster of the OpenLDAP test suite, 我们将通过cn=config配置slapd(8)
这里设置配置数据库:
     dn: cn=config
     objectClass: olcGlobal
     cn: config
     olcServerID: 1

     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     olcDatabase: {0}config
     olcRootPW: secret
第二和第三服务器明显会有一个不同的 olcServerID:
     dn: cn=config
     objectClass: olcGlobal
     cn: config
     olcServerID: 2

     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     olcDatabase: {0}config
     olcRootPW: secret
这里设置 syncrepl 为提供者 (因为这些都是主服务器):
     dn: cn=module,cn=config
     objectClass: olcModuleList
     cn: module
     olcModulePath: /usr/local/libexec/openldap
     olcModuleLoad: syncprov.la
现在我们设置第一个主节点 (使用你自己的确切的urls替换掉 $URI1, $URI2 和 $URI3 等.):
     dn: cn=config
     changetype: modify
     replace: olcServerID
     olcServerID: 1 $URI1
     olcServerID: 2 $URI2
     olcServerID: 3 $URI3

     dn: olcOverlay=syncprov,olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     changetype: add
     objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
     objectClass: olcSyncProvConfig
     olcOverlay: syncprov
    
     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     changetype: modify
     add: olcSyncRepl
     olcSyncRepl: rid=001 provider=$URI1 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=002 provider=$URI2 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=003 provider=$URI3 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     -
     add: olcMirrorMode
     olcMirrorMode: TRUE
现在启动主服务器和一个或多个消费者服务器, 也把上面的 LDIF 加入到第一个消费者, 第二个消费者等等. 然后它将复制cn=config. 你现在就在config数据库上拥有了多路多主机.
我们仍不得不复制实际的数据, 而不仅是 config, 所以添加下面这些到主服务器(所有激活的和配置好的消费者/主服务器将领取这个配置, 因为他们都是在同步的). 同样的, 以任何对你的安装可用的设置替换所有 ${} 变量:
     dn: olcDatabase={1}$BACKEND,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     objectClass: olc${BACKEND}Config
     olcDatabase: {1}$BACKEND
     olcSuffix: $BASEDN
     olcDbDirectory: ./db
     olcRootDN: $MANAGERDN
     olcRootPW: $PASSWD
     olcLimits: dn.exact="$MANAGERDN" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited
     olcSyncRepl: rid=004 provider=$URI1 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=005 provider=$URI2 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=006 provider=$URI3 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcMirrorMode: TRUE

     dn: olcOverlay=syncprov,olcDatabase={1}${BACKEND},cn=config
     changetype: add
     objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
     objectClass: olcSyncProvConfig
     olcOverlay: syncprov
注意: 你的所有服务器始终必须使用例如 NTP http://www.ntp.org/, 原子钟, 或一些其他可用的时间参照物紧紧同步.
注意: 如slapd-config(5)指出的, 在 olcSyncRepl 指示中定义的 URLs 是从它们那里复制的服务器的 URLs. 这些必须准确地匹配 slapd 监听(命令行参数选项的 -h )的URLs . 否则 slapd 可能尝试从它自身复制, 而导致循环.
MirrorMode

镜像模式配置实际上非常容易. 如果你已经配置了一个普通的 slapd syncrepl 提供者, 那么唯一的改变就是以下两个参数:
       mirrormode  on
       serverID    1
注意: 你需要确保每个镜像的serverID是不同的并且把它作为一个全球配置选项.
Mirror Node配置

第一步是配置syncrepl提供者，就像 配置提供者slapd 一节写的那样.
注意: Delta-syncrepl还不支持镜像模式.
这里是从一个在refreshAndPersist模式下使用LDAP同步复制的例子中截取的片断:
镜像模式节点 1:
       # 全球部分
       serverID    1
       # 数据库部分

       # syncrepl参数
       syncrepl      rid=001
                     provider=ldap://ldap-sid2.example.com
                     bindmethod=simple
                     binddn="cn=mirrormode,dc=example,dc=com"
                     credentials=mirrormode
                     searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                     schemachecking=on
                     type=refreshAndPersist
                     retry="60 +"
    
       mirrormode on
镜像模式节点 2:
       # 全球部分
       serverID    2
       # 数据库部分

       # syncrepl参数
       syncrepl      rid=001
                     provider=ldap://ldap-sid1.example.com
                     bindmethod=simple
                     binddn="cn=mirrormode,dc=example,dc=com"
                     credentials=mirrormode
                     searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                     schemachecking=on
                     type=refreshAndPersist
                     retry="60 +"
    
       mirrormode on
它真的很简单; 每个镜像模式节点设置得完全一样, 除了 serverID 是唯一的, 并且每个消费者都被指向另一个服务器.
容错配置

这通常有两个选择; 1. 硬件代理/负载均衡 或 专用的代理软件, 2. 使用一个 Back-LDAP 代理作为一个 syncrepl 提供者
一个典型的企业例子可能是:

图 X.Y: 在一个双数据中心配置中使用镜像模式
标准消费者配置

这和设置消费者slapd一节完全一样. 可以设置一个普通的复制模式, 也可以使用 delta-syncrepl 复制模式.
MirrorMode总结

现在你将有一个目录架构提供单主服务器复制的全部一致性保障, 同时也提供多主服务器复制的高可用性.

你能看到我们在这里使用了 updatedn 参数,而它的示范 ACLs (usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.acl) 可能如下:
        # 给复制DN无限的读权限.  这个ACL可能需要和其他ACL声明配合.
        #

        access to *
             by dn.base="cn=replicator,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" write
             by * break
    
        access to dn.base=""

        access to dn.base="cn=Subschema"
                by * read
    
        access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"

        access to *
                by self write
                by * read
为了支持更多的复制, 只要加入更多的数据库 ldap 节并相应增加 syncrepl rid 号码.
注意: 你必须以相同的数据填充主目录和从目录, 而不是像使用普通Syncrepl时候那样
如果你没有修改主目录配置的权限，你可以配置一个独立的ldap代理, 它看起来像这样:

        overlay         syncprov
如你所见, 使用Syncrepl和slapd-ldap(8) 剪裁你的复制来满足你的特有的网络拓扑，你可以让自己的想象力变得很疯狂.

5.2.6. BDB and HDB Database Directives

Directives in this category apply to both the BDB and the HDB database. They are used in an olcDatabase entry in addition to the generic database directives defined above. For a complete reference of BDB/HDB configuration directives, see slapd-bdb(5). In addition to the olcDatabaseConfig objectClass, BDB and HDB database entries must have the olcBdbConfig and olcHdbConfig objectClass, respectively.
5.2.6.1. olcDbDirectory: <directory>

This directive specifies the directory where the BDB files containing the database and associated indices live.

Default:

        olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data

5.2.6.2. olcDbCachesize: <integer>

This directive specifies the size in entries of the in-memory cache maintained by the BDB backend database instance.

Default:

        olcDbCachesize: 1000

5.2.6.3. olcDbCheckpoint: <kbyte> <min>

This directive specifies how often to checkpoint the BDB transaction log. A checkpoint operation flushes the database buffers to disk and writes a checkpoint record in the log. The checkpoint will occur if either <kbyte> data has been written or <min> minutes have passed since the last checkpoint. Both arguments default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When the <min> argument is non-zero, an internal task will run every <min> minutes to perform the checkpoint. See the Berkeley DB reference guide for more details.

Example:

        olcDbCheckpoint: 1024 10

5.2.6.4. olcDbConfig: <DB_CONFIG setting>

This attribute specifies a configuration directive to be placed in the DB_CONFIG file of the database directory. At server startup time, if no such file exists yet, the DB_CONFIG file will be created and the settings in this attribute will be written to it. If the file exists, its contents will be read and displayed in this attribute. The attribute is multi-valued, to accommodate multiple configuration directives. No default is provided, but it is essential to use proper settings here to get the best server performance.

Any changes made to this attribute will be written to the DB_CONFIG file and will cause the database environment to be reset so the changes can take immediate effect. If the environment cache is large and has not been recently checkpointed, this reset operation may take a long time. It may be advisable to manually perform a single checkpoint using the Berkeley DB db_checkpoint utility before using LDAP Modify to change this attribute.

Example:

        olcDbConfig: set_cachesize 0 10485760 0
        olcDbConfig: set_lg_bsize 2097512
        olcDbConfig: set_lg_dir /var/tmp/bdb-log
        olcDbConfig: set_flags DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE

In this example, the BDB cache is set to 10MB, the BDB transaction log buffer size is set to 2MB, and the transaction log files are to be stored in the /var/tmp/bdb-log directory. Also a flag is set to tell BDB to delete transaction log files as soon as their contents have been checkpointed and they are no longer needed. Without this setting the transaction log files will continue to accumulate until some other cleanup procedure removes them. See the Berkeley DB documentation for the db_archive command for details. For a complete list of Berkeley DB flags please see - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/api_c/env_set_flags.html

Ideally the BDB cache must be at least as large as the working set of the database, the log buffer size should be large enough to accommodate most transactions without overflowing, and the log directory must be on a separate physical disk from the main database files. And both the database directory and the log directory should be separate from disks used for regular system activities such as the root, boot, or swap filesystems. See the FAQ-o-Matic and the Berkeley DB documentation for more details.
5.2.6.5. olcDbNosync: { TRUE | FALSE }

This option causes on-disk database contents to not be immediately synchronized with in memory changes upon change. Setting this option to TRUE may improve performance at the expense of data integrity. This directive has the same effect as using

        olcDbConfig: set_flags DB_TXN_NOSYNC

5.2.6.6. olcDbIDLcacheSize: <integer>

Specify the size of the in-memory index cache, in index slots. The default is zero. A larger value will speed up frequent searches of indexed entries. The optimal size will depend on the data and search characteristics of the database, but using a number three times the entry cache size is a good starting point.

Example:

        olcDbIDLcacheSize: 3000

5.2.6.7. olcDbIndex: {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

This directive specifies the indices to maintain for the given attribute. If only an <attrlist> is given, the default indices are maintained. The index keywords correspond to the common types of matches that may be used in an LDAP search filter.

Example:

        olcDbIndex: default pres,eq
        olcDbIndex: uid
        olcDbIndex: cn,sn pres,eq,sub
        olcDbIndex: objectClass eq

The first line sets the default set of indices to maintain to present and equality. The second line causes the default (pres,eq) set of indices to be maintained for the uid attribute type. The third line causes present, equality, and substring indices to be maintained for cn and sn attribute types. The fourth line causes an equality index for the objectClass attribute type.

There is no index keyword for inequality matches. Generally these matches do not use an index. However, some attributes do support indexing for inequality matches, based on the equality index.

A substring index can be more explicitly specified as subinitial, subany, or subfinal, corresponding to the three possible components of a substring match filter. A subinitial index only indexes substrings that appear at the beginning of an attribute value. A subfinal index only indexes substrings that appear at the end of an attribute value, while subany indexes substrings that occur anywhere in a value.

Note that by default, setting an index for an attribute also affects every subtype of that attribute. E.g., setting an equality index on the name attribute causes cn, sn, and every other attribute that inherits from name to be indexed.

By default, no indices are maintained. It is generally advised that minimally an equality index upon objectClass be maintained.

        olcDbindex: objectClass eq

Additional indices should be configured corresponding to the most common searches that are used on the database. Presence indexing should not be configured for an attribute unless the attribute occurs very rarely in the database, and presence searches on the attribute occur very frequently during normal use of the directory. Most applications don't use presence searches, so usually presence indexing is not very useful.

If this setting is changed while slapd is running, an internal task will be run to generate the changed index data. All server operations can continue as normal while the indexer does its work. If slapd is stopped before the index task completes, indexing will have to be manually completed using the slapindex tool.
5.2.6.8. olcDbLinearIndex: { TRUE | FALSE }

If this setting is TRUE slapindex will index one attribute at a time. The default settings is FALSE in which case all indexed attributes of an entry are processed at the same time. When enabled, each indexed attribute is processed individually, using multiple passes through the entire database. This option improves slapindex performance when the database size exceeds the BDB cache size. When the BDB cache is large enough, this option is not needed and will decrease performance. Also by default, slapadd performs full indexing and so a separate slapindex run is not needed. With this option, slapadd does no indexing and slapindex must be used.
5.2.6.9. olcDbMode: { <octal> | <symbolic> }

This directive specifies the file protection mode that newly created database index files should have. This can be in the form 0600 or -rw-------

Default:

        olcDbMode: 0600

5.2.6.10. olcDbSearchStack: <integer>

Specify the depth of the stack used for search filter evaluation. Search filters are evaluated on a stack to accommodate nested AND / OR clauses. An individual stack is allocated for each server thread. The depth of the stack determines how complex a filter can be evaluated without requiring any additional memory allocation. Filters that are nested deeper than the search stack depth will cause a separate stack to be allocated for that particular search operation. These separate allocations can have a major negative impact on server performance, but specifying too much stack will also consume a great deal of memory. Each search uses 512K bytes per level on a 32-bit machine, or 1024K bytes per level on a 64-bit machine. The default stack depth is 16, thus 8MB or 16MB per thread is used on 32 and 64 bit machines, respectively. Also the 512KB size of a single stack slot is set by a compile-time constant which may be changed if needed; the code must be recompiled for the change to take effect.

Default:

        olcDbSearchStack: 16

5.2.6.11. olcDbShmKey: <integer>

Specify a key for a shared memory BDB environment. By default the BDB environment uses memory mapped files. If a non-zero value is specified, it will be used as the key to identify a shared memory region that will house the environment.

Example:

        olcDbShmKey: 42

5.2.6.12. Sample Entry

dn: olcDatabase=hdb,cn=config
objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
objectClass: olcHdbConfig
olcDatabase: hdb
olcSuffix: "dc=example,dc=com"
olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
olcDbCacheSize: 1000
olcDbCheckpoint: 1024 10
olcDbConfig: set_cachesize 0 10485760 0
olcDbConfig: set_lg_bsize 2097152
olcDbConfig: set_lg_dir /var/tmp/bdb-log
olcDbConfig: set_flags DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE
olcDbIDLcacheSize: 3000
olcDbIndex: objectClass eq

5.3. Configuration Example

The following is an example configuration, interspersed with explanatory text. It defines two databases to handle different parts of the X.500 tree; both are BDB database instances. The line numbers shown are provided for reference only and are not included in the actual file. First, the global configuration section:

  1.    # example config file - global configuration entry
  2.    dn: cn=config
  3.    objectClass: olcGlobal
  4.    cn: config
  5.    olcReferral: ldap://root.openldap.org

    6.

Line 1 is a comment. Lines 2-4 identify this as the global configuration entry. The olcReferral: directive on line 5 means that queries not local to one of the databases defined below will be referred to the LDAP server running on the standard port (389) at the host root.openldap.org. Line 6 is a blank line, indicating the end of this entry.

  7.    # internal schema
  8.    dn: cn=schema,cn=config
  9.    objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
 10.    cn: schema
 11.

Line 7 is a comment. Lines 8-10 identify this as the root of the schema subtree. The actual schema definitions in this entry are hardcoded into slapd so no additional attributes are specified here. Line 11 is a blank line, indicating the end of this entry.

 12.    # include the core schema
 13.    include: file:///usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.ldif
 14.

Line 12 is a comment. Line 13 is an LDIF include directive which accesses the core schema definitions in LDIF format. Line 14 is a blank line.

Next comes the database definitions. The first database is the special frontend database whose settings are applied globally to all the other databases.

 15.    # global database parameters
 16.    dn: olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config
 17.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 18.    olcDatabase: frontend
 19.    olcAccess: to * by * read
 20.

Line 15 is a comment. Lines 16-18 identify this entry as the global database entry. Line 19 is a global access control. It applies to all entries (after any applicable database-specific access controls). Line 20 is a blank line.

The next entry defines the config backend.

 21.    # set a rootpw for the config database so we can bind.
 22.    # deny access to everyone else.
 23.    dn: olcDatabase=config,cn=config
 24.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 25.    olcDatabase: config
 26.    olcRootPW: {SSHA}XKYnrjvGT3wZFQrDD5040US592LxsdLy
 27.    olcAccess: to * by * none
 28.

Lines 21-22 are comments. Lines 23-25 identify this entry as the config database entry. Line 26 defines the super-user password for this database. (The DN defaults to "cn=config".) Line 27 denies all access to this database, so only the super-user will be able to access it. (This is already the default access on the config database. It is just listed here for illustration, and to reiterate that unless a means to authenticate as the super-user is explicitly configured, the config database will be inaccessible.)

Line 28 is a blank line.

The next entry defines a BDB backend that will handle queries for things in the "dc=example,dc=com" portion of the tree. Indices are to be maintained for several attributes, and the userPassword attribute is to be protected from unauthorized access.

 29.    # BDB definition for example.com
 30.    dn: olcDatabase=bdb,cn=config
 31.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 32.    objectClass: olcBdbConfig
 33.    olcDatabase: bdb
 34.    olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
 35.    olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
 36.    olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
 37.    olcRootPW: secret
 38.    olcDbIndex: uid pres,eq
 39.    olcDbIndex: cn,sn pres,eq,approx,sub
 40.    olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
 41.    olcAccess: to attrs=userPassword
 42.      by self write
 43.      by anonymous auth
 44.      by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 45.      by * none
 46.    olcAccess: to *
 47.      by self write
 48.      by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 49.      by * read
 50.

Line 29 is a comment. Lines 30-33 identify this entry as a BDB database configuration entry. Line 34 specifies the DN suffix for queries to pass to this database. Line 35 specifies the directory in which the database files will live.

Lines 36 and 37 identify the database super-user entry and associated password. This entry is not subject to access control or size or time limit restrictions.

Lines 38 through 40 indicate the indices to maintain for various attributes.

Lines 41 through 49 specify access control for entries in this database. For all applicable entries, the userPassword attribute is writable by the entry itself and by the "admin" entry. It may be used for authentication/authorization purposes, but is otherwise not readable. All other attributes are writable by the entry and the "admin" entry, but may be read by all users (authenticated or not).

Line 50 is a blank line, indicating the end of this entry.

The next entry defines another BDB database. This one handles queries involving the dc=example,dc=net subtree but is managed by the same entity as the first database. Note that without line 60, the read access would be allowed due to the global access rule at line 19.

 51.    # BDB definition for example.net
 52.    dn: olcDatabase=bdb,cn=config
 53.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 54.    objectClass: olcBdbConfig
 55.    olcDatabase: bdb
 56.    olcSuffix: "dc=example,dc=net"
 57.    olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data-net
 58.    olcRootDN: "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 59.    olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
 60.    olcAccess: to * by users read

5.4. Converting old style slapd.conf(5) file to cn=config format

Before converting to the cn=config format you should make sure that the config backend is properly configured in your existing config file. While the config backend is always present inside slapd, by default it is only accessible by its rootDN, and there are no default credentials assigned so unless you explicitly configure a means to authenticate to it, it will be unusable.

If you do not already have a database config section, add something like this to the end of slapd.conf

 database config
 rootpw VerySecret

Note: Since the config backend can be used to load arbitrary code into the slapd process, it is extremely important to carefully guard whatever credentials are used to access it. Since simple passwords are vulnerable to password guessing attacks, it is usually better to omit the rootpw and only use SASL authentication for the config rootDN.

An existing slapd.conf(5) file can be converted to the new format using slaptest(8) or any of the slap tools:

        slaptest -f /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d

Test that you can access entries under cn=config using the default rootdn and the rootpw configured above:

        ldapsearch -x -D cn=config -w VerySecret -b cn=config

You can then discard the old slapd.conf(5) file. Make sure to launch slapd(8) with the -F option to specify the configuration directory if you are not using the default directory path.

Note: When converting from the slapd.conf format to slapd.d format, any included files will also be integrated into the resulting configuration database.

6. The slapd Configuration File

This chapter describes configuring slapd(8) via the slapd.conf(5) configuration file. slapd.conf(5) has been deprecated and should only be used if your site requires one of the backends that hasn't yet been updated to work with the newer slapd-config(5) system. Configuring slapd(8) via slapd-config(5) is described in the previous chapter.

The slapd.conf(5) file is normally installed in the /usr/local/etc/openldap directory. An alternate configuration file location can be specified via a command-line option to slapd(8).
6.1. Configuration File Format

The slapd.conf(5) file consists of three types of configuration information: global, backend specific, and database specific. Global information is specified first, followed by information associated with a particular backend type, which is then followed by information associated with a particular database instance. Global directives can be overridden in backend and/or database directives, and backend directives can be overridden by database directives.

Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a '#' character are ignored. If a line begins with whitespace, it is considered a continuation of the previous line (even if the previous line is a comment).

The general format of slapd.conf is as follows:

        # global configuration directives
        <global config directives>
    
        # backend definition
        backend <typeA>
        <backend-specific directives>
    
        # first database definition & config directives
        database <typeA>
        <database-specific directives>
    
        # second database definition & config directives
        database <typeB>
        <database-specific directives>
    
        # second database definition & config directives
        database <typeA>
        <database-specific directives>
    
        # subsequent backend & database definitions & config directives
        ...

A configuration directive may take arguments. If so, they are separated by whitespace. If an argument contains whitespace, the argument should be enclosed in double quotes "like this". If an argument contains a double quote or a backslash character `\', the character should be preceded by a backslash character `\'.

The distribution contains an example configuration file that will be installed in the /usr/local/etc/openldap directory. A number of files containing schema definitions (attribute types and object classes) are also provided in the /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema directory.
6.2. Configuration File Directives

This section details commonly used configuration directives. For a complete list, see the slapd.conf(5) manual page. This section separates the configuration file directives into global, backend-specific and data-specific categories, describing each directive and its default value (if any), and giving an example of its use.
6.2.1. Global Directives

Directives described in this section apply to all backends and databases unless specifically overridden in a backend or database definition. Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets <>.
6.2.1.1. access to <what> [ by <who> [<accesslevel>] [<control>] ]+

This directive grants access (specified by <accesslevel>) to a set of entries and/or attributes (specified by <what>) by one or more requestors (specified by <who>). See the Access Control section of this guide for basic usage.

Note: If no access directives are specified, the default access control policy, access to * by * read, allows all both authenticated and anonymous users read access.

6.2.1.2. attributetype <RFC4512 Attribute Type Description>

This directive defines an attribute type. Please see the Schema Specification chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.
6.2.1.3. idletimeout <integer>

Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an idle client connection. An idletimeout of 0, the default, disables this feature.
6.2.1.4. include <filename>

This directive specifies that slapd should read additional configuration information from the given file before continuing with the next line of the current file. The included file should follow the normal slapd config file format. The file is commonly used to include files containing schema specifications.

Note: You should be careful when using this directive - there is no small limit on the number of nested include directives, and no loop detection is done.

6.2.1.5. loglevel <level>

This directive specifies the level at which debugging statements and operation statistics should be syslogged (currently logged to the syslogd(8) LOG_LOCAL4 facility). You must have configured OpenLDAP --enable-debug (the default) for this to work (except for the two statistics levels, which are always enabled). Log levels may be specified as integers or by keyword. Multiple log levels may be used and the levels are additive. To display what numbers correspond to what kind of debugging, invoke slapd with -d? or consult the table below. The possible values for <integer> are:
Table 6.1: Debugging Levels Level 	Keyword 	Description
-1 	any 	enable all debugging
0 	  	no debugging
1 	(0x1 trace) 	trace function calls
2 	(0x2 packets) 	debug packet handling
4 	(0x4 args) 	heavy trace debugging
8 	(0x8 conns) 	connection management
16 	(0x10 BER) 	print out packets sent and received
32 	(0x20 filter) 	search filter processing
64 	(0x40 config) 	configuration processing
128 	(0x80 ACL) 	access control list processing
256 	(0x100 stats) 	stats log connections/operations/results
512 	(0x200 stats2) 	stats log entries sent
1024 	(0x400 shell) 	print communication with shell backends
2048 	(0x800 parse) 	print entry parsing debugging
16384 	(0x4000 sync) 	syncrepl consumer processing
32768 	(0x8000 none) 	only messages that get logged whatever log level is set

The desired log level can be input as a single integer that combines the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal or in hexadecimal notation, as a list of integers (that are ORed internally), or as a list of the names that are shown between brackets, such that

                loglevel 129
                loglevel 0x81
                loglevel 128 1
                loglevel 0x80 0x1
                loglevel acl trace

are equivalent.

Examples:

 loglevel -1

This will cause lots and lots of debugging information to be logged.

 loglevel conns filter

Just log the connection and search filter processing.

 loglevel none

Log those messages that are logged regardless of the configured loglevel. This differs from setting the log level to 0, when no logging occurs. At least the None level is required to have high priority messages logged.

Default:

 loglevel stats

Basic stats logging is configured by default. However, if no loglevel is defined, no logging occurs (equivalent to a 0 level).
6.2.1.6. objectclass <RFC4512 Object Class Description>

This directive defines an object class. Please see the Schema Specification chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.
6.2.1.7. referral <URI>

This directive specifies the referral to pass back when slapd cannot find a local database to handle a request.

Example:

        referral ldap://root.openldap.org

This will refer non-local queries to the global root LDAP server at the OpenLDAP Project. Smart LDAP clients can re-ask their query at that server, but note that most of these clients are only going to know how to handle simple LDAP URLs that contain a host part and optionally a distinguished name part.
6.2.1.8. sizelimit <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.

Default:

        sizelimit 500

See the Limits section of this guide and slapd.conf(5) for more details.
6.2.1.9. timelimit <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will spend answering a search request. If a request is not finished in this time, a result indicating an exceeded timelimit will be returned.

Default:

        timelimit 3600

See the Limits section of this guide and slapd.conf(5) for more details.
6.2.2. General Backend Directives

Directives in this section apply only to the backend in which they are defined. They are supported by every type of backend. Backend directives apply to all databases instances of the same type and, depending on the directive, may be overridden by database directives.
6.2.2.1. backend <type>

This directive marks the beginning of a backend declaration. <type> should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 6.2.
Table 6.2: Database Backends Types 	Description
bdb 	Berkeley DB transactional backend
dnssrv 	DNS SRV backend
hdb 	Hierarchical variant of bdb backend
ldap 	Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Proxy) backend
meta 	Meta Directory backend
monitor 	Monitor backend
passwd 	Provides read-only access to passwd(5)
perl 	Perl Programmable backend
shell 	Shell (extern program) backend
sql 	SQL Programmable backend

Example:

        backend bdb

This marks the beginning of a new BDB backend definition.
6.2.3. General Database Directives

Directives in this section apply only to the database in which they are defined. They are supported by every type of database.
6.2.3.1. database <type>

This directive marks the beginning of a database instance declaration. <type> should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 6.2.

Example:

        database bdb

This marks the beginning of a new BDB database instance declaration.
6.2.3.2. limits <who> <limit> [<limit> [...]]

Specify time and size limits based on who initiated an operation.

See the Limits section of this guide and slapd.conf(5) for more details.
6.2.3.3. readonly { on | off }

This directive puts the database into "read-only" mode. Any attempts to modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.

Default:

        readonly off

6.2.3.4. rootdn <DN>

This directive specifies the DN that is not subject to access control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database. The DN need not refer to an entry in this database or even in the directory. The DN may refer to a SASL identity.

Entry-based Example:

        rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"

SASL-based Example:

        rootdn "uid=root,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth"

See the SASL Authentication section for information on SASL authentication identities.
6.2.3.5. rootpw <password>

This directive can be used to specifies a password for the DN for the rootdn (when the rootdn is set to a DN within the database).

Example:

        rootpw secret

It is also permissible to provide hash of the password in RFC2307 form. slappasswd(8) may be used to generate the password hash.

Example:

        rootpw {SSHA}ZKKuqbEKJfKSXhUbHG3fG8MDn9j1v4QN

The hash was generated using the command slappasswd -s secret.
6.2.3.6. suffix <dn suffix>

This directive specifies the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend database. Multiple suffix lines can be given, and at least one is required for each database definition.

Example:

        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

Queries with a DN ending in "dc=example,dc=com" will be passed to this backend.

Note: When the backend to pass a query to is selected, slapd looks at the suffix line(s) in each database definition in the order they appear in the file. Thus, if one database suffix is a prefix of another, it must appear after it in the config file.

6.2.3.7. syncrepl

        syncrepl rid=<replica ID>
                provider=ldap[s]://<hostname>[:port]
                [type=refreshOnly|refreshAndPersist]
                [interval=dd:hh:mm:ss]
                [retry=[<retry interval> <# of retries>]+]
                searchbase=<base DN>
                [filter=<filter str>]
                [scope=sub|one|base]
                [attrs=<attr list>]
                [attrsonly]
                [sizelimit=<limit>]
                [timelimit=<limit>]
                [schemachecking=on|off]
                [bindmethod=simple|sasl]
                [binddn=<DN>]
                [saslmech=<mech>]
                [authcid=<identity>]
                [authzid=<identity>]
                [credentials=<passwd>]
                [realm=<realm>]
                [secprops=<properties>]
                [starttls=yes|critical]
                [tls_cert=<file>]
                [tls_key=<file>]
                [tls_cacert=<file>]
                [tls_cacertdir=<path>]
                [tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
                [tls_ciphersuite=<ciphers>]
                [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]
                [logbase=<base DN>]
                [logfilter=<filter str>]
                [syncdata=default|accesslog|changelog]

This directive specifies the current database as a replica of the master content by establishing the current slapd(8) as a replication consumer site running a syncrepl replication engine. The master database is located at the replication provider site specified by the provider parameter. The replica database is kept up-to-date with the master content using the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol. See RFC4533 for more information on the protocol.

The rid parameter is used for identification of the current syncrepl directive within the replication consumer server, where <replica ID> uniquely identifies the syncrepl specification described by the current syncrepl directive. <replica ID> is non-negative and is no more than three decimal digits in length.

The provider parameter specifies the replication provider site containing the master content as an LDAP URI. The provider parameter specifies a scheme, a host and optionally a port where the provider slapd instance can be found. Either a domain name or IP address may be used for <hostname>. Examples are ldap://provider.example.com:389 or ldaps://192.168.1.1:636. If <port> is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used. Note that the syncrepl uses a consumer-initiated protocol, and hence its specification is located at the consumer site, whereas the replica specification is located at the provider site. syncrepl and replica directives define two independent replication mechanisms. They do not represent the replication peers of each other.

The content of the syncrepl replica is defined using a search specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send search requests to the provider slapd according to the search specification. The search specification includes searchbase, scope, filter, attrs, attrsonly, sizelimit, and timelimit parameters as in the normal search specification. The searchbase parameter has no default value and must always be specified. The scope defaults to sub, the filter defaults to (objectclass=*), attrs defaults to "*,+" to replicate all user and operational attributes, and attrsonly is unset by default. Both sizelimit and timelimit default to "unlimited", and only positive integers or "unlimited" may be specified.

The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types: refreshOnly and refreshAndPersist. The operation type is specified by the type parameter. In the refreshOnly operation, the next synchronization search operation is periodically rescheduled at an interval time after each synchronization operation finishes. The interval is specified by the interval parameter. It is set to one day by default. In the refreshAndPersist operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the provider slapd instance. Further updates to the master replica will generate searchResultEntry to the consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent synchronization search.

If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt to reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of the <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs. For example, retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next three times before stop retrying. + in <# of retries> means indefinite number of retries until success.

The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site by turning on the schemachecking parameter. If it is turned on, every replicated entry will be checked for its schema as the entry is stored into the replica content. Every entry in the replica should contain those attributes required by the schema definition. If it is turned off, entries will be stored without checking schema conformance. The default is off.

The binddn parameter gives the DN to bind as for the syncrepl searches to the provider slapd. It should be a DN which has read access to the replication content in the master database.

The bindmethod is simple or sasl, depending on whether simple password-based authentication or SASL authentication is to be used when connecting to the provider slapd instance.

Simple authentication should not be used unless adequate data integrity and confidentiality protections are in place (e.g. TLS or IPsec). Simple authentication requires specification of binddn and credentials parameters.

SASL authentication is generally recommended. SASL authentication requires specification of a mechanism using the saslmech parameter. Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using authcid and credentials, respectively. The authzid parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.

The realm parameter specifies a realm which a certain mechanisms authenticate the identity within. The secprops parameter specifies Cyrus SASL security properties.

The starttls parameter specifies use of the StartTLS extended operation to establish a TLS session before authenticating to the provider. If the critical argument is supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl session continues without TLS. The tls_reqcert setting defaults to "demand" and the other TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings.

Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs of data modifications. This mode of operation is referred to as delta syncrepl. In addition to the above parameters, the logbase and logfilter parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will be used. The syncdata parameter must be set to either "accesslog" if the log conforms to the slapo-accesslog(5) log format, or "changelog" if the log conforms to the obsolete changelog format. If the syncdata parameter is omitted or set to "default" then the log parameters are ignored.

The syncrepl replication mechanism is supported by the bdb, hdb, and mdb backends.

See the LDAP Sync Replication chapter of this guide for more information on how to use this directive.
6.2.3.8. updateref <URL>

This directive is only applicable in a slave (or shadow) slapd(8) instance. It specifies the URL to return to clients which submit update requests upon the replica. If specified multiple times, each URL is provided.

Example:

        updateref       ldap://master.example.net

6.2.4. BDB and HDB Database Directives

Directives in this category only apply to both the BDB and the HDB database. That is, they must follow a "database bdb" or "database hdb" line and come before any subsequent "backend" or "database" line. For a complete reference of BDB/HDB configuration directives, see slapd-bdb(5).
6.2.4.1. directory <directory>

This directive specifies the directory where the BDB files containing the database and associated indices live.

Default:

        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

6.3. Configuration File Example

The following is an example configuration file, interspersed with explanatory text. It defines two databases to handle different parts of the X.500 tree; both are BDB database instances. The line numbers shown are provided for reference only and are not included in the actual file. First, the global configuration section:

  1.    # example config file - global configuration section
  2.    include /usr/local/etc/schema/core.schema
  3.    referral ldap://root.openldap.org
  4.    access to * by * read

Line 1 is a comment. Line 2 includes another config file which contains core schema definitions. The referral directive on line 3 means that queries not local to one of the databases defined below will be referred to the LDAP server running on the standard port (389) at the host root.openldap.org.

Line 4 is a global access control. It applies to all entries (after any applicable database-specific access controls).

The next section of the configuration file defines a BDB backend that will handle queries for things in the "dc=example,dc=com" portion of the tree. The database is to be replicated to two slave slapds, one on truelies, the other on judgmentday. Indices are to be maintained for several attributes, and the userPassword attribute is to be protected from unauthorized access.

  5.    # BDB definition for the example.com
  6.    database bdb
  7.    suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
  8.    directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
  9.    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 10.    rootpw secret
 11.    # indexed attribute definitions
 12.    index uid pres,eq
 13.    index cn,sn pres,eq,approx,sub
 14.    index objectClass eq
 15.    # database access control definitions
 16.    access to attrs=userPassword
 17.        by self write
 18.        by anonymous auth
 19.        by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 20.        by * none
 21.    access to *
 22.        by self write
 23.        by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 24.        by * read

Line 5 is a comment. The start of the database definition is marked by the database keyword on line 6. Line 7 specifies the DN suffix for queries to pass to this database. Line 8 specifies the directory in which the database files will live.

Lines 9 and 10 identify the database super-user entry and associated password. This entry is not subject to access control or size or time limit restrictions.

Lines 12 through 14 indicate the indices to maintain for various attributes.

Lines 16 through 24 specify access control for entries in this database. For all applicable entries, the userPassword attribute is writable by the entry itself and by the "admin" entry. It may be used for authentication/authorization purposes, but is otherwise not readable. All other attributes are writable by the entry and the "admin" entry, but may be read by all users (authenticated or not).

The next section of the example configuration file defines another BDB database. This one handles queries involving the dc=example,dc=net subtree but is managed by the same entity as the first database. Note that without line 39, the read access would be allowed due to the global access rule at line 4.

 33.    # BDB definition for example.net
 34.    database bdb
 35.    suffix "dc=example,dc=net"
 36.    directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data-net
 37.    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 38.    index objectClass eq
 39.    access to * by users read

7. Running slapd

slapd(8) is designed to be run as a standalone service. This allows the server to take advantage of caching, manage concurrency issues with underlying databases, and conserve system resources. Running from inetd(8) is NOT an option.
7.1. Command-Line Options

slapd(8) supports a number of command-line options as detailed in the manual page. This section details a few commonly used options.

        -f <filename>

This option specifies an alternate configuration file for slapd. The default is normally /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf.

        -F <slapd-config-directory>

Specifies the slapd configuration directory. The default is /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d.

If both -f and -F are specified, the config file will be read and converted to config directory format and written to the specified directory. If neither option is specified, slapd will attempt to read the default config directory before trying to use the default config file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config file is ignored. All of the slap tools that use the config options observe this same behavior.

        -h <URLs>

This option specifies alternative listener configurations. The default is ldap:/// which implies LDAP over TCP on all interfaces on the default LDAP port 389. You can specify specific host-port pairs or other protocol schemes (such as ldaps:// or ldapi://).
URL 	Protocol 	Transport
ldap:/// 	LDAP 	TCP port 389
ldaps:/// 	LDAP over SSL 	TCP port 636
ldapi:/// 	LDAP 	IPC (Unix-domain socket)

For example, -h "ldaps:// ldap://127.0.0.1:666" will create two listeners: one for the (non-standard) ldaps:// scheme on all interfaces on the default ldaps:// port 636, and one for the standard ldap:// scheme on the localhost (loopback) interface on port 666. Hosts may be specified using using hostnames or IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Port values must be numeric.

For LDAP over IPC, the pathname of the Unix-domain socket can be encoded in the URL. Note that directory separators must be URL-encoded, like any other characters that are special to URLs. Thus the socket /usr/local/var/ldapi must be encoded as

        ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi

ldapi: is described in detail in Using LDAP Over IPC Mechanisms [Chu-LDAPI]

Note that the ldapi:/// transport is not widely implemented: non-OpenLDAP clients may not be able to use it.

        -n <service-name>

This option specifies the service name used for logging and other purposes. The default service name is slapd.

        -l <syslog-local-user>

This option specifies the local user for the syslog(8) facility. Values can be LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2, ..., and LOCAL7. The default is LOCAL4. This option may not be supported on all systems.

        -u user -g group

These options specify the user and group, respectively, to run as. user can be either a user name or uid. group can be either a group name or gid.

        -r directory

This option specifies a run-time directory. slapd will chroot(2) to this directory after opening listeners but before reading any configuration files or initializing any backends.

        -d <level> | ?

This option sets the slapd debug level to <level>. When level is a `?' character, the various debugging levels are printed and slapd exits, regardless of any other options you give it. Current debugging levels are
Table 7.1: Debugging Levels Level 	Keyword 	Description
-1 	any 	enable all debugging
0 	  	no debugging
1 	(0x1 trace) 	trace function calls
2 	(0x2 packets) 	debug packet handling
4 	(0x4 args) 	heavy trace debugging
8 	(0x8 conns) 	connection management
16 	(0x10 BER) 	print out packets sent and received
32 	(0x20 filter) 	search filter processing
64 	(0x40 config) 	configuration processing
128 	(0x80 ACL) 	access control list processing
256 	(0x100 stats) 	stats log connections/operations/results
512 	(0x200 stats2) 	stats log entries sent
1024 	(0x400 shell) 	print communication with shell backends
2048 	(0x800 parse) 	print entry parsing debugging
16384 	(0x4000 sync) 	syncrepl consumer processing
32768 	(0x8000 none) 	only messages that get logged whatever log level is set

You may enable multiple levels by specifying the debug option once for each desired level. Or, since debugging levels are additive, you can do the math yourself. That is, if you want to trace function calls and watch the config file being processed, you could set level to the sum of those two levels (in this case, -d 65). Or, you can let slapd do the math, (e.g. -d 1 -d 64). Consult <ldap_log.h> for more details.

Note: slapd must have been compiled with --enable-debug defined for any debugging information beyond the two stats levels to be available (the default).

7.2. Starting slapd

In general, slapd is run like this:

        /usr/local/libexec/slapd [<option>]*

where /usr/local/libexec is determined by configure and <option> is one of the options described above (or in slapd(8)). Unless you have specified a debugging level (including level 0), slapd will automatically fork and detach itself from its controlling terminal and run in the background.
7.3. Stopping slapd

To kill off slapd(8) safely, you should give a command like this

        kill -INT `cat /usr/local/var/slapd.pid`

where /usr/local/var is determined by configure.

Killing slapd by a more drastic method may cause information loss or database corruption.

8. Access Control
8.1. Introduction

As the directory gets populated with more and more data of varying sensitivity, controlling the kinds of access granted to the directory becomes more and more critical. For instance, the directory may contain data of a confidential nature that you may need to protect by contract or by law. Or, if using the directory to control access to other services, inappropriate access to the directory may create avenues of attack to your sites security that result in devastating damage to your assets.

Access to your directory can be configured via two methods, the first using The slapd Configuration File and the second using the slapd-config(5) format (Configuring slapd).

The default access control policy is allow read by all clients. Regardless of what access control policy is defined, the rootdn is always allowed full rights (i.e. auth, search, compare, read and write) on everything and anything.

As a consequence, it's useless (and results in a performance penalty) to explicitly list the rootdn among the <by> clauses.

The following sections will describe Access Control Lists in greater depth and follow with some examples and recommendations. See slapd.access(5) for complete details.
8.2. Access Control via Static Configuration

Access to entries and attributes is controlled by the access configuration file directive. The general form of an access line is:

    <access directive> ::= access to <what>
        [by <who> [<access>] [<control>] ]+
    <what> ::= * |
        [dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [filter=<ldapfilter>] [attrs=<attrlist>]
    <basic-style> ::= regex | exact
    <scope-style> ::= base | one | subtree | children
    <attrlist> ::= <attr> [val[.<basic-style>]=<regex>] | <attr> , <attrlist>
    <attr> ::= <attrname> | entry | children
    <who> ::= * | [anonymous | users | self
            | dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [dnattr=<attrname>]
        [group[/<objectclass>[/<attrname>][.<basic-style>]]=<regex>]
        [peername[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockname[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [domain[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockurl[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [set=<setspec>]
        [aci=<attrname>]
    <access> ::= [self]{<level>|<priv>}
    <level> ::= none | disclose | auth | compare | search | read | write | manage
    <priv> ::= {=|+|-}{m|w|r|s|c|x|d|0}+
    <control> ::= [stop | continue | break]

where the <what> part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the <who> part specifies which entities are granted access, and the <access> part specifies the access granted. Multiple <who> <access> <control> triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these access control options are described here; for more details see the slapd.access(5) man page.
8.2.1. What to control access to

The <what> part of an access specification determines the entries and attributes to which the access control applies. Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter. The following qualifiers select entries by DN:

    to *
    to dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>
    to dn.<scope-style>=<DN>

The first form is used to select all entries. The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the target entry's normalized DN. (The second form is not discussed further in this document.) The third form is used to select entries which are within the requested scope of DN. The <DN> is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in RFC4514.

The scope can be either base, one, subtree, or children. Where base matches only the entry with provided DN, one matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, subtree matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and children matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).

For example, if the directory contained entries named:

    0: o=suffix
    1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
    2: ou=people,o=suffix
    3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix

Then:

    dn.base="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2;
    dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, and 5;
    dn.subtree="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and
    dn.children="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, 4, and 5.

Entries may also be selected using a filter:

    to filter=<ldap filter>

where <ldap filter> is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in RFC4515. For example:

    to filter=(objectClass=person)

Note that entries may be selected by both DN and filter by including both qualifiers in the <what> clause.

    to dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" filter=(objectClass=person)

Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the <what> selector:

    attrs=<attribute list>

A specific value of an attribute is selected by using a single attribute name and also using a value selector:

    attrs=<attribute> val[.<style>]=<regex>

There are two special pseudo attributes entry and children. To read (and hence return) a target entry, the subject must have read access to the target's entry attribute. To perform a search, the subject must have search access to the search base's entry attribute. To add or delete an entry, the subject must have write access to the entry's entry attribute AND must have write access to the entry's parent's children attribute. To rename an entry, the subject must have write access to entry's entry attribute AND have write access to both the old parent's and new parent's children attributes. The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.

Lastly, there is a special entry selector "*" that is used to select any entry. It is used when no other <what> selector has been provided. It's equivalent to "dn=.*"
8.2.2. Who to grant access to

The <who> part identifies the entity or entities being granted access. Note that access is granted to "entities" not "entries." The following table summarizes entity specifiers:
Table 6.3: Access Entity Specifiers Specifier 	Entities
* 	All, including anonymous and authenticated users
	anonymous 	Anonymous (non-authenticated) users
	users 	Authenticated users
	self 	User associated with target entry
	dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> 	Users matching a regular expression
	dn.<scope-style>=<DN> 	Users within scope of a DN

The DN specifier behaves much like <what> clause DN specifiers.

Other control factors are also supported. For example, a <who> can be restricted by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:

    dnattr=<dn-valued attribute name>

The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).

Some factors may not be appropriate in all environments (or any). For example, the domain factor relies on IP to domain name lookups. As these can easily be spoofed, the domain factor should be avoided.
8.2.3. The access to grant

The kind of <access> granted can be one of the following:
Table 6.4: Access Levels Level 	Privileges 	Description
none = 	0 	no access
disclose = 	d 	needed for information disclosure on error
auth = 	dx 	needed to authenticate (bind)
compare = 	cdx 	needed to compare
search = 	scdx 	needed to apply search filters
read = 	rscdx 	needed to read search results
write = 	wrscdx 	needed to modify/rename
manage = 	mwrscdx 	needed to manage

Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone write access to an entry also grants them read, search, compare, auth and disclose access. However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.
8.2.4. Access Control Evaluation

When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the <what> selectors given in the configuration file. For each entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the entry (or the global access directives if not held in any database) apply first, followed by the global access directives. However, when dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

Within this priority, access directives are examined in the order in which they appear in the config file. Slapd stops with the first <what> selector that matches the entry and/or attribute. The corresponding access directive is the one slapd will use to evaluate access.

Next, slapd compares the entity requesting access to the <who> selectors within the access directive selected above in the order in which they appear. It stops with the first <who> selector that matches the requester. This determines the access the entity requesting access has to the entry and/or attribute.

Finally, slapd compares the access granted in the selected <access> clause to the access requested by the client. If it allows greater or equal access, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.

The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should appear first in the config file. Similarly, if one <who> selector is more specific than another it should come first in the access directive. The access control examples given below should help make this clear.
8.2.5. Access Control Examples

The access control facility described above is quite powerful. This section shows some examples of its use for descriptive purposes.

A simple example:

    access to * by * read

This access directive grants read access to everyone.

    access to *
        by self write
        by anonymous auth
        by * read

This directive allows the user to modify their entry, allows anonymous to authentication against these entries, and allows all others to read these entries. Note that only the first by <who> clause which matches applies. Hence, the anonymous users are granted auth, not read. The last clause could just as well have been "by users read".

It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of protection in place. The following shows how security strength factors (SSF) can be used.

    access to *
        by ssf=128 self write
        by ssf=64 anonymous auth
        by ssf=64 users read

This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security protections have of strength 128 or better have been established, allows authentication access to anonymous users, and read access when 64 or better security protections have been established. If client has not establish sufficient security protections, the implicit by * none clause would be applied.

The following example shows the use of a style specifiers to select the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant.

    access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    access to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read

Read access is granted to entries under the dc=com subtree, except for those entries under the dc=example,dc=com subtree, to which search access is granted. No access is granted to dc=com as neither access directive matches this DN. If the order of these access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be reached, since all entries under dc=example,dc=com are also under dc=com entries.

Also note that if no access to directive matches or no by <who> clause, access is denied. That is, every access to directive ends with an implicit by * none clause. When dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the by <who> clauses. It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various <who> selectors.

    access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=homePhone
        by self write
        by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
        by peername.regex=IP:10\..+ read
    access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
        by self write
        by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
        by anonymous auth

This example applies to entries in the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree. To all attributes except homePhone, an entry can write to itself, entries under example.com entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit by * none) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously). The homePhone attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under example.com, readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable (implicit by * none). All other access is denied by the implicit access to * by * none.

Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like this:

    access to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite

The dnattr <who> selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the member attribute. The selfwrite access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access any of the entry's attributes.
8.3. Access Control via Dynamic Configuration

Access to slapd entries and attributes is controlled by the olcAccess attribute, whose values are a sequence of access directives. The general form of the olcAccess configuration is:

    olcAccess: <access directive>
    <access directive> ::= to <what>
        [by <who> [<access>] [<control>] ]+
    <what> ::= * |
        [dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [filter=<ldapfilter>] [attrs=<attrlist>]
    <basic-style> ::= regex | exact
    <scope-style> ::= base | one | subtree | children
    <attrlist> ::= <attr> [val[.<basic-style>]=<regex>] | <attr> , <attrlist>
    <attr> ::= <attrname> | entry | children
    <who> ::= * | [anonymous | users | self
            | dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [dnattr=<attrname>]
        [group[/<objectclass>[/<attrname>][.<basic-style>]]=<regex>]
        [peername[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockname[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [domain[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockurl[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [set=<setspec>]
        [aci=<attrname>]
    <access> ::= [self]{<level>|<priv>}
    <level> ::= none | disclose | auth | compare | search | read | write | manage
    <priv> ::= {=|+|-}{m|w|r|s|c|x|d|0}+
    <control> ::= [stop | continue | break]

where the <what> part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the <who> part specifies which entities are granted access, and the <access> part specifies the access granted. Multiple <who> <access> <control> triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these access control options are described here; for more details see the slapd.access(5) man page.
8.3.1. What to control access to

The <what> part of an access specification determines the entries and attributes to which the access control applies. Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter. The following qualifiers select entries by DN:

    to *
    to dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>
    to dn.<scope-style>=<DN>

The first form is used to select all entries. The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the target entry's normalized DN. (The second form is not discussed further in this document.) The third form is used to select entries which are within the requested scope of DN. The <DN> is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in RFC4514.

The scope can be either base, one, subtree, or children. Where base matches only the entry with provided DN, one matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, subtree matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and children matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).

For example, if the directory contained entries named:

    0: o=suffix
    1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
    2: ou=people,o=suffix
    3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix

Then:

    dn.base="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2;
    dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, and 5;
    dn.subtree="ou=people,o=suffix" match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and
    dn.children="ou=people,o=suffix" match 3, 4, and 5.

Entries may also be selected using a filter:

    to filter=<ldap filter>

where <ldap filter> is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in RFC4515. For example:

    to filter=(objectClass=person)

Note that entries may be selected by both DN and filter by including both qualifiers in the <what> clause.

    to dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" filter=(objectClass=person)

Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the <what> selector:

    attrs=<attribute list>

A specific value of an attribute is selected by using a single attribute name and also using a value selector:

    attrs=<attribute> val[.<style>]=<regex>

There are two special pseudo attributes entry and children. To read (and hence return) a target entry, the subject must have read access to the target's entry attribute. To perform a search, the subject must have search access to the search base's entry attribute. To add or delete an entry, the subject must have write access to the entry's entry attribute AND must have write access to the entry's parent's children attribute. To rename an entry, the subject must have write access to entry's entry attribute AND have write access to both the old parent's and new parent's children attributes. The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.

Lastly, there is a special entry selector "*" that is used to select any entry. It is used when no other <what> selector has been provided. It's equivalent to "dn=.*"
8.3.2. Who to grant access to

The <who> part identifies the entity or entities being granted access. Note that access is granted to "entities" not "entries." The following table summarizes entity specifiers:
Table 5.3: Access Entity Specifiers Specifier 	Entities
* 	All, including anonymous and authenticated users
	anonymous 	Anonymous (non-authenticated) users
	users 	Authenticated users
	self 	User associated with target entry
	dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> 	Users matching a regular expression
	dn.<scope-style>=<DN> 	Users within scope of a DN

The DN specifier behaves much like <what> clause DN specifiers.

Other control factors are also supported. For example, a <who> can be restricted by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:

    dnattr=<dn-valued attribute name>

The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).

Some factors may not be appropriate in all environments (or any). For example, the domain factor relies on IP to domain name lookups. As these can easily be spoofed, the domain factor should be avoided.
8.3.3. The access to grant

The kind of <access> granted can be one of the following:
Table 5.4: Access Levels Level 	Privileges 	Description
none 	=0 	no access
disclose 	=d 	needed for information disclosure on error
auth 	=dx 	needed to authenticate (bind)
compare 	=cdx 	needed to compare
search 	=scdx 	needed to apply search filters
read 	=rscdx 	needed to read search results
write 	=wrscdx 	needed to modify/rename
manage 	=mwrscdx 	needed to manage

Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone write access to an entry also grants them read, search, compare, auth and disclose access. However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.
8.3.4. Access Control Evaluation

When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the <what> selectors given in the configuration. For each entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the entry (or the global access directives if not held in any database) apply first, followed by the global access directives (which are held in the frontend database definition). However, when dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

Within this priority, access directives are examined in the order in which they appear in the configuration attribute. Slapd stops with the first <what> selector that matches the entry and/or attribute. The corresponding access directive is the one slapd will use to evaluate access.

Next, slapd compares the entity requesting access to the <who> selectors within the access directive selected above in the order in which they appear. It stops with the first <who> selector that matches the requester. This determines the access the entity requesting access has to the entry and/or attribute.

Finally, slapd compares the access granted in the selected <access> clause to the access requested by the client. If it allows greater or equal access, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.

The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should appear first in the configuration. Similarly, if one <who> selector is more specific than another it should come first in the access directive. The access control examples given below should help make this clear.
8.3.5. Access Control Examples

The access control facility described above is quite powerful. This section shows some examples of its use for descriptive purposes.

A simple example:

    olcAccess: to * by * read

This access directive grants read access to everyone.

    olcAccess: to *
        by self write
        by anonymous auth
        by * read

This directive allows the user to modify their entry, allows anonymous to authenticate against these entries, and allows all others to read these entries. Note that only the first by <who> clause which matches applies. Hence, the anonymous users are granted auth, not read. The last clause could just as well have been "by users read".

It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of protection in place. The following shows how security strength factors (SSF) can be used.

    olcAccess: to *
        by ssf=128 self write
        by ssf=64 anonymous auth
        by ssf=64 users read

This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security protections of strength 128 or better have been established, allows authentication access to anonymous users, and read access when strength 64 or better security protections have been established. If the client has not establish sufficient security protections, the implicit by * none clause would be applied.

The following example shows the use of style specifiers to select the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant.

    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read

Read access is granted to entries under the dc=com subtree, except for those entries under the dc=example,dc=com subtree, to which search access is granted. No access is granted to dc=com as neither access directive matches this DN. If the order of these access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be reached, since all entries under dc=example,dc=com are also under dc=com entries.

Also note that if no olcAccess: to directive matches or no by <who> clause, access is denied. When dealing with an access list, because the global access list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit access to * by * none directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the by <who> clauses. It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various <who> selectors.

    olcAccess: to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=homePhone
        by self write
        by dn.children=dc=example,dc=com" search
        by peername.regex=IP:10\..+ read
    olcAccess: to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
        by self write
        by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
        by anonymous auth

This example applies to entries in the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree. To all attributes except homePhone, an entry can write to itself, entries under example.com entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit by * none) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously). The homePhone attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under example.com, readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable (implicit by * none). All other access is denied by the implicit access to * by * none.

Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like this:

    olcAccess: to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite

The dnattr <who> selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the member attribute. The selfwrite access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access any of the entry's attributes.
8.3.6. Access Control Ordering

Since the ordering of olcAccess directives is essential to their proper evaluation, but LDAP attributes normally do not preserve the ordering of their values, OpenLDAP uses a custom schema extension to maintain a fixed ordering of these values. This ordering is maintained by prepending a "{X}" numeric index to each value, similarly to the approach used for ordering the configuration entries. These index tags are maintained automatically by slapd and do not need to be specified when originally defining the values. For example, when you create the settings

    olcAccess: to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read

when you read them back using slapcat or ldapsearch they will contain

    olcAccess: {0}to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
    olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    olcAccess: {2}to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read

The numeric index may be used to specify a particular value to change when using ldapmodify to edit the access rules. This index can be used instead of (or in addition to) the actual access value. Using this numeric index is very helpful when multiple access rules are being managed.

For example, if we needed to change the second rule above to grant write access instead of search, we could try this LDIF:

    changetype: modify
    delete: olcAccess
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * search
    -
    add: olcAccess
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * write
    -

But this example will not guarantee that the existing values remain in their original order, so it will most likely yield a broken security configuration. Instead, the numeric index should be used:

    changetype: modify
    delete: olcAccess
    olcAccess: {1}
    -
    add: olcAccess
    olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * write
    -

This example deletes whatever rule is in value #1 of the olcAccess attribute (regardless of its value) and adds a new value that is explicitly inserted as value #1. The result will be

    olcAccess: {0}to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
    olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * write
    olcAccess: {2}to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read

which is exactly what was intended.
8.4. Access Control Common Examples
8.4.1. Basic ACLs

Generally one should start with some basic ACLs such as:

    access to attr=userPassword
        by self =xw
        by anonymous auth
        by * none


      access to *
        by self write
        by users read
        by * none

The first ACL allows users to update (but not read) their passwords, anonymous users to authenticate against this attribute, and (implicitly) denying all access to others.

The second ACL allows users full access to their entry, authenticated users read access to anything, and (implicitly) denying all access to others (in this case, anonymous users).
8.4.2. Matching Anonymous and Authenticated users

An anonymous user has a empty DN. While the dn.exact="" or dn.regex="^$" could be used, slapd(8)) offers an anonymous shorthand which should be used instead.

    access to *
      by anonymous none
      by * read

denies all access to anonymous users while granting others read.

Authenticated users have a subject DN. While dn.regex=".+" will match any authenticated user, OpenLDAP provides the users short hand which should be used instead.

    access to *
      by users read
      by * none

This ACL grants read permissions to authenticated users while denying others (i.e.: anonymous users).
8.4.3. Controlling rootdn access

You could specify the rootdn in slapd.conf(5) or slapd.d without specifying a rootpw. Then you have to add an actual directory entry with the same dn, e.g.:

    dn: cn=Manager,o=MyOrganization
    cn: Manager
    sn: Manager
    objectClass: person
    objectClass: top
    userPassword: {SSHA}someSSHAdata

Then binding as the rootdn will require a regular bind to that DN, which in turn requires auth access to that entry's DN and userPassword, and this can be restricted via ACLs. E.g.:

    access to dn.base="cn=Manager,o=MyOrganization"
      by peername.regex=127\.0\.0\.1 auth
      by peername.regex=192\.168\.0\..* auth
      by users none
      by * none

The ACLs above will only allow binding using rootdn from localhost and 192.168.0.0/24.
8.4.4. Managing access with Groups

There are a few ways to do this. One approach is illustrated here. Consider the following DIT layout:

    +-dc=example,dc=com
    +---cn=administrators,dc=example,dc=com
    +---cn=fred blogs,dc=example,dc=com

and the following group object (in LDIF format):

    dn: cn=administrators,dc=example,dc=com
    cn: administrators of this region
    objectclass: groupOfNames  (important for the group acl feature)
    member: cn=fred blogs,dc=example,dc=com
    member: cn=somebody else,dc=example,dc=com

One can then grant access to the members of this this group by adding appropriate by group clause to an access directive in slapd.conf(5). For instance,

    access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
        by self write
        by group.exact="cn=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" write
        by * auth

Like by dn clauses, one can also use expand to expand the group name based upon the regular expression matching of the target, that is, the to dn.regex). For instance,

    access to dn.regex="(.+,)?ou=People,(dc=[^,]+,dc=[^,]+)$"
             attrs=children,entry,uid
        by group.expand="cn=Managers,$2" write
        by users read
        by * auth

The above illustration assumed that the group members are to be found in the member attribute type of the groupOfNames object class. If you need to use a different group object and/or a different attribute type then use the following slapd.conf(5) (abbreviated) syntax:

    access to <what>
            by group/<objectclass>/<attributename>=<DN> <access>

For example:

    access to *
      by group/organizationalRole/roleOccupant="cn=Administrator,dc=example,dc=com" write

In this case, we have an ObjectClass organizationalRole which contains the administrator DN's in the roleOccupant attribute. For instance:

    dn: cn=Administrator,dc=example,dc=com
    cn: Administrator
    objectclass: organizationalRole
    roleOccupant: cn=Jane Doe,dc=example,dc=com

Note: the specified member attribute type MUST be of DN or NameAndOptionalUID syntax, and the specified object class SHOULD allow the attribute type.

Dynamic Groups are also supported in Access Control. Please see slapo-dynlist(5) and the Dynamic Lists overlay section.
8.4.5. Granting access to a subset of attributes

You can grant access to a set of attributes by specifying a list of attribute names in the ACL to clause. To be useful, you also need to grant access to the entry itself. Also note how children controls the ability to add, delete, and rename entries.

    # mail: self may write, authenticated users may read
    access to attrs=mail
      by self write
      by users read
      by * none
    
    # cn, sn: self my write, all may read
    access to attrs=cn,sn
      by self write
      by * read
    
    # immediate children: only self can add/delete entries under this entry
    access to attrs=children
      by self write
    
    # entry itself: self may write, all may read
    access to attrs=entry
      by self write
      by * read
    
    # other attributes: self may write, others have no access
    access to *
      by self write
      by * none

ObjectClass names may also be specified in this list, which will affect all the attributes that are required and/or allowed by that objectClass. Actually, names in attrlist that are prefixed by @ are directly treated as objectClass names. A name prefixed by ! is also treated as an objectClass, but in this case the access rule affects the attributes that are not required nor allowed by that objectClass.
8.4.6. Allowing a user write to all entries below theirs

For a setup where a user can write to its own record and to all of its children:

    access to dn.regex="(.+,)?(uid=[^,]+,o=Company)$"
       by dn.exact,expand="$2" write
       by anonymous auth

(Add more examples for above)
8.4.7. Allowing entry creation

Let's say, you have it like this:

        o=<basedn>
            ou=domains
                associatedDomain=<somedomain>
                    ou=users
                        uid=<someuserid>
                        uid=<someotheruserid>
                    ou=addressbooks
                        uid=<someuserid>
                            cn=<someone>
                            cn=<someoneelse>

and, for another domain <someotherdomain>:

        o=<basedn>
            ou=domains
                associatedDomain=<someotherdomain>
                    ou=users
                        uid=<someuserid>
                        uid=<someotheruserid>
                    ou=addressbooks
                        uid=<someotheruserid>
                            cn=<someone>
                            cn=<someoneelse>

then, if you wanted user uid=<someuserid> to ONLY create an entry for its own thing, you could write an ACL like this:

    # this rule lets users of "associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>"
    # write under "ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>,ou=domains,o=<basedn>",
    # i.e. a user can write ANY entry below its domain's address book;
    # this permission is necessary, but not sufficient, the next
    # will restrict this permission further


    access to dn.regex="^ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=([^,]+),ou=domains,o=<basedn>$" attrs=children
            by dn.regex="^uid=([^,]+),ou=users,associatedDomain=$1,ou=domains,o=<basedn>$$" write
            by * none


    # Note that above the "by" clause needs a "regex" style to make sure
    # it expands to a DN that starts with a "uid=<someuserid>" pattern
    # while substituting the associatedDomain submatch from the "what" clause.


    # This rule lets a user with "uid=<matcheduid>" of "<associatedDomain=matcheddomain>"
    # write (i.e. add, modify, delete) the entry whose DN is exactly
    # "uid=<matcheduid>,ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>,ou=domains,o=<basedn>"
    # and ANY entry as subtree of it


    access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=([^,]+),ou=domains,o=<basedn>$"
            by dn.exact,expand="uid=$2,ou=users,associatedDomain=$3,ou=domains,o=<basedn>" write
            by * none


    # Note that above the "by" clause uses the "exact" style with the "expand"
    # modifier because now the whole pattern can be rebuilt by means of the
    # submatches from the "what" clause, so a "regex" compilation and evaluation
    # is no longer required.

8.4.8. Tips for using regular expressions in Access Control

Always use dn.regex=<pattern> when you intend to use regular expression matching. dn=<pattern> alone defaults to dn.exact<pattern>.

Use (.+) instead of (.*) when you want at least one char to be matched. (.*) matches the empty string as well.

Don't use regular expressions for matches that can be done otherwise in a safer and cheaper manner. Examples:

    dn.regex=".*dc=example,dc=com"

is unsafe and expensive:

    unsafe because any string containing dc=example,dc=com will match, not only those that end with the desired pattern; use .*dc=example,dc=com$ instead.
    unsafe also because it would allow any attributeType ending with dc as naming attribute for the first RDN in the string, e.g. a custom attributeType mydc would match as well. If you really need a regular expression that allows just dc=example,dc=com or any of its subtrees, use ^(.+,)?dc=example,dc=com$, which means: anything to the left of dc=..., if any (the question mark after the pattern within brackets), must end with a comma;
    expensive because if you don't need submatches, you could use scoping styles, e.g.
    
    dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"

to include dc=example,dc=com in the matching patterns,

    dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"

to exclude dc=example,dc=com from the matching patterns, or

    dn.onelevel="dc=example,dc=com"

to allow exactly one sublevel matches only.

Always use ^ and $ in regexes, whenever appropriate, because ou=(.+),ou=(.+),ou=addressbooks,o=basedn will match something=bla,ou=xxx,ou=yyy,ou=addressbooks,o=basedn,ou=addressbooks,o=basedn,dc=some,dc=org

Always use ([^,]+) to indicate exactly one RDN, because (.+) can include any number of RDNs; e.g. ou=(.+),dc=example,dc=com will match ou=My,o=Org,dc=example,dc=com, which might not be what you want.

Never add the rootdn to the by clauses. ACLs are not even processed for operations performed with rootdn identity (otherwise there would be no reason to define a rootdn at all).

Use shorthands. The user directive matches authenticated users and the anonymous directive matches anonymous users.

Don't use the dn.regex form for <by> clauses if all you need is scoping and/or substring replacement; use scoping styles (e.g. exact, onelevel, children or subtree) and the style modifier expand to cause substring expansion.

For instance,

    access to dn.regex=".+,dc=([^,]+),dc=([^,]+)$"
      by dn.regex="^[^,],ou=Admin,dc=$1,dc=$2$$" write

although correct, can be safely and efficiently replaced by

    access to dn.regex=".+,(dc=[^,]+,dc=[^,]+)$"
      by dn.onelevel,expand="ou=Admin,$1" write

where the regex in the <what> clause is more compact, and the one in the <by> clause is replaced by a much more efficient scoping style of onelevel with substring expansion.
8.4.9. Granting and Denying access based on security strength factors (ssf)

You can restrict access based on the security strength factor (SSF)

    access to dn="cn=example,cn=edu"
          by * ssf=256 read

0 (zero) implies no protection, 1 implies integrity protection only, 56 DES or other weak ciphers, 112 triple DES and other strong ciphers, 128 RC4, Blowfish and other modern strong ciphers.

Other possibilities:

    transport_ssf=<n>
    tls_ssf=<n>
    sasl_ssf=<n>

256 is recommended.

See slapd.conf(5) for information on ssf.
8.4.10. When things aren't working as expected

Consider this example:

    access to *
      by anonymous auth
    
    access to *
      by self write
    
    access to *
      by users read

You may think this will allow any user to login, to read everything and change his own data if he is logged in. But in this example only the login works and an ldapsearch returns no data. The Problem is that SLAPD goes through its access config line by line and stops as soon as it finds a match in the part of the access rule.(here: to *)

To get what we wanted the file has to read:

    access to *
      by anonymous auth
      by self write
      by users read

The general rule is: "special access rules first, generic access rules last"

See also slapd.access(5), loglevel 128 and slapacl(8) for debugging information.
8.5. Sets - Granting rights based on relationships

Sets are best illustrated via examples. The following sections will present a few set ACL examples in order to facilitate their understanding.

(Sets in Access Controls FAQ Entry: http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1133.html)

Note: Sets are considered experimental.

8.5.1. Groups of Groups

The OpenLDAP ACL for groups doesn't expand groups within groups, which are groups that have another group as a member. For example:

 dn: cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: sudoadm
 objectClass: groupOfNames
 member: uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
 member: cn=accountadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com

 dn: cn=accountadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: accountadm
 objectClass: groupOfNames
 member: uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

If we use standard group ACLs with the above entries and allow members of the sudoadm group to write somewhere, mary won't be included:

 access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
         by group.exact="cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com" write
         by * read

With sets we can make the ACL be recursive and consider group within groups. So for each member that is a group, it is further expanded:

 access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
       by set="[cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/member* & user" write
       by * read

This set ACL means: take the cn=sudoadm DN, check its member attribute(s) (where the "*" means recursively) and intersect the result with the authenticated user's DN. If the result is non-empty, the ACL is considered a match and write access is granted.

The following drawing explains how this set is built:

Figure X.Y: Populating a recursive group set

First we get the uid=john DN. This entry doesn't have a member attribute, so the expansion stops here. Now we get to cn=accountadm. This one does have a member attribute, which is uid=mary. The uid=mary entry, however, doesn't have member, so we stop here again. The end comparison is:

 {"uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com","uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"} & user

If the authenticated user's DN is any one of those two, write access is granted. So this set will include mary in the sudoadm group and she will be allowed the write access.
8.5.2. Group ACLs without DN syntax

The traditional group ACLs, and even the previous example about recursive groups, require that the members are specified as DNs instead of just usernames.

With sets, however, it's also possible to use simple names in group ACLs, as this example will show.

Let's say we want to allow members of the sudoadm group to write to the ou=suders branch of our tree. But our group definition now is using memberUid for the group members:

 dn: cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: sudoadm
 objectClass: posixGroup
 gidNumber: 1000
 memberUid: john

With this type of group, we can't use group ACLs. But with a set ACL we can grant the desired access:

 access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
       by set="[cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/memberUid & user/uid" write
       by * read

We use a simple intersection where we compare the uid attribute of the connecting (and authenticated) user with the memberUid attributes of the group. If they match, the intersection is non-empty and the ACL will grant write access.

This drawing illustrates this set when the connecting user is authenticated as uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com:

Figure X.Y: Sets with memberUid

In this case, it's a match. If it were mary authenticating, however, she would be denied write access to ou=sudoers because her uid attribute is not listed in the group's memberUid.
8.5.3. Following references

We will now show a quite powerful example of what can be done with sets. This example tends to make OpenLDAP administrators smile after they have understood it and its implications.

Let's start with an user entry:

 dn: uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
 uid: john
 objectClass: inetOrgPerson
 givenName: John
 sn: Smith
 cn: john
 manager: uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

Writing an ACL to allow the manager to update some attributes is quite simple using sets:

 access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
    by self write
    by set="this/manager & user" write
    by * read

In that set, this expands to the entry being accessed, so that this/manager expands to uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com when john's entry is accessed. If the manager herself is accessing John's entry, the ACL will match and write access to those attributes will be granted.

So far, this same behavior can be obtained with the dnattr keyword. With sets, however, we can further enhance this ACL. Let's say we want to allow the secretary of the manager to also update these attributes. This is how we do it:

 access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
    by self write
    by set="this/manager & user" write
    by set="this/manager/secretary & user" write
    by * read

Now we need a picture to help explain what is happening here (entries shortened for clarity):

Figure X.Y: Sets jumping through entries

In this example, Jane is the secretary of Mary, which is the manager of John. This whole relationship is defined with the manager and secretary attributes, which are both of the distinguishedName syntax (i.e., full DNs). So, when the uid=john entry is being accessed, the this/manager/secretary set becomes {"uid=jane,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"} (follow the references in the picture):

 this = [uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]
 this/manager = \
   [uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]/manager = uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
 this/manager/secretary = \
   [uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]/secretary = uid=jane,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

The end result is that when Jane accesses John's entry, she will be granted write access to the specified attributes. Better yet, this will happen to any entry she accesses which has Mary as the manager.

This is all cool and nice, but perhaps gives too much power to secretaries. Maybe we need to further restrict it. For example, let's only allow executive secretaries to have this power:

 access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
   attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
   by self write
   by set="this/manager & user" write
   by set="this/manager/secretary &
           [cn=executive,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/member* &
           user" write
   by * read

It's almost the same ACL as before, but we now also require that the connecting user be a member of the (possibly nested) cn=executive group.

9. Limits
9.1. Introduction

It is usually desirable to limit the server resources that can be consumed by each LDAP client. OpenLDAP provides two sets of limits: a size limit, which can restrict the number of entries that a client can retrieve in a single operation, and a time limit which restricts the length of time that an operation may continue. Both types of limit can be given different values depending on who initiated the operation.
9.2. Soft and Hard limits

The server administrator can specify both soft limits and hard limits. Soft limits can be thought of as being the default limit value. Hard limits cannot be exceeded by ordinary LDAP users.

LDAP clients can specify their own size and time limits when issuing search operations. This feature has been present since the earliest version of X.500.

If the client specifies a limit then the lower of the requested value and the hard limit will become the limit for the operation.

If the client does not specify a limit then the server applies the soft limit.

Soft and Hard limits are often referred to together as administrative limits. Thus, if an LDAP client requests a search that would return more results than the limits allow it will get an adminLimitExceeded error. Note that the server will usually return some results even if the limit has been exceeded: this feature is useful to clients that just want to check for the existence of some entries without needing to see them all.

The rootdn is not subject to any limits.
9.3. Global Limits

Limits specified in the global part of the server configuration act as defaults which are used if no database has more specific limits set.

In a slapd.conf(5) configuration the keywords are sizelimit and timelimit. When using the slapd config backend, the corresponding attributes are olcSizeLimit and olcTimeLimit. The syntax of these values are the same in both cases.

The simple form sets both soft and hard limits to the same value:

   sizelimit {<integer>|unlimited}
   timelimit {<integer>|unlimited}

The default sizelimit is 500 entries and the default timelimit is 3600 seconds.

An extended form allows soft and hard limits to be set separately:

   sizelimit size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer> [...]
   timelimit time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]

Thus, to set a soft sizelimit of 10 entries and a hard limit of 75 entries:

  sizelimit size.soft=10 size.hard=75

The unchecked keyword sets a limit on how many entries the server will examine once it has created an initial set of candidate results by using indices. This can be very important in a large directory, as a search that cannot be satisfied from an index might cause the server to examine millions of entries, therefore always make sure the correct indexes are configured.
9.4. Per-Database Limits

Each database can have its own set of limits that override the global ones. The syntax is more flexible, and it allows different limits to be applied to different entities. Note that an entity is different from an entry: the term entity is used here to indicate the ID of the person or process that has initiated the LDAP operation.

In a slapd.conf(5) configuration the keyword is limits. When using the slapd config backend, the corresponding attribute is olcLimits. The syntax of the values is the same in both cases.

   limits <who> <limit> [<limit> [...]]

The limits clause can be specified multiple times to apply different limits to different initiators. The server examines each clause in turn until it finds one that matches the ID that requested the operation. If no match is found, the global limits will be used.
9.4.1. Specify who the limits apply to

The <who> part of the limits clause can take any of these values:
Table ZZZ.ZZZ: Entity Specifiers Specifier 	Entities
* 	All, including anonymous and authenticated users
	anonymous 	Anonymous (non-authenticated) users
	users 	Authenticated users
	self 	User associated with target entry
	dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> 	Users matching a regular expression
	dn.<scope-style>=<DN> 	Users within scope of a DN
	group[/oc[/at]]=<pattern> 	Members of a group

The rules for specifying <who> are the same as those used in access-control rules.
9.4.2. Specify time limits

The syntax for time limits is

   time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer>

where integer is the number of seconds slapd will spend answering a search request.

If neither soft nor hard is specified, the value is used for both, e.g.:

   limits anonymous time=27

The value unlimited may be used to remove the hard time limit entirely, e.g.:

   limits dn.exact="cn=anyuser,dc=example,dc=org" time.hard=unlimited

9.4.3. Specifying size limits

The syntax for size limit is

   size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer>

where <integer> is the maximum number of entries slapd will return when answering a search request.

Soft, hard, and "unchecked" limits are available, with the same meanings described for the global limits configuration above.
9.4.4. Size limits and Paged Results

If the LDAP client adds the pagedResultsControl to the search operation, the hard size limit is used by default, because the request for a specific page size is considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number of entries to be returned. However, the size limit applies to the total count of entries returned within the search, and not to a single page.

Additional size limits may be enforced for paged searches.

The size.pr limit controls the maximum page size:

   size.pr={<integer>|noEstimate|unlimited}

<integer> is the maximum page size if no explicit size is set. noEstimate has no effect in the current implementation as the server does not return an estimate of the result size anyway. unlimited indicates that no limit is applied to the maximum page size.

The size.prtotal limit controls the total number of entries that can be returned by a paged search. By default the limit is the same as the normal size.hard limit.

   size.prtotal={<integer>|unlimited|disabled}

unlimited removes the limit on the number of entries that can be returned by a paged search. disabled can be used to selectively disable paged result searches.
9.5. Example Limit Configurations
9.5.1. Simple Global Limits

This simple global configuration fragment applies size and time limits to all searches by all users except rootdn. It limits searches to 50 results and sets an overall time limit of 10 seconds.

   sizelimit 50
   timelimit 10

9.5.2. Global Hard and Soft Limits

It is sometimes useful to limit the size of result sets but to allow clients to request a higher limit where needed. This can be achieved by setting separate hard and soft limits.

   sizelimit size.soft=5 size.hard=100

To prevent clients from doing very inefficient non-indexed searches, add the unchecked limit:

   sizelimit size.soft=5 size.hard=100 size.unchecked=100

9.5.3. Giving specific users larger limits

Having set appropriate default limits in the global configuration, you may want to give certain users the ability to retrieve larger result sets. Here is a way to do that in the per-database configuration:

   limits dn.exact="cn=anyuser,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
   limits dn.exact="cn=personnel,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
   limits dn.exact="cn=dirsync,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000

It is generally best to avoid mentioning specific users in the server configuration. A better way is to give the higher limits to a group:

   limits group/groupOfNames/member="cn=bigwigs,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000

9.5.4. Limiting who can do paged searches

It may be required that certain applications need very large result sets that they retrieve using paged searches, but that you do not want ordinary LDAP users to use the pagedResults control. The pr and prtotal limits can help:

   limits group/groupOfNames/member="cn=dirsync,dc=example,dc=org" size.prtotal=unlimited
   limits users size.soft=5 size.hard=100 size.prtotal=disabled
   limits anonymous size.soft=2 size.hard=5 size.prtotal=disabled

9.6. Further Information

10. Database Creation and Maintenance Tools

This section tells you how to create a slapd database from scratch, and how to do trouble shooting if you run into problems. There are two ways to create a database. First, you can create the database on-line using LDAP. With this method, you simply start up slapd and add entries using the LDAP client of your choice. This method is fine for relatively small databases (a few hundred or thousand entries, depending on your requirements). This method works for database types which support updates.

The second method of database creation is to do it off-line using special utilities provided with slapd(8). This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an unacceptably long time using the LDAP method, or if you want to ensure the database is not accessed while it is being created. Note that not all database types support these utilities.
10.1. Creating a database over LDAP

With this method, you use the LDAP client of your choice (e.g., the ldapadd(1)) to add entries, just like you would once the database is created. You should be sure to set the following options in the configuration file before starting slapd(8).

        suffix <dn>

As described in the General Database Directives section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you are trying to create. For example:

        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:

        directory <directory>

For example:

        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

You need to create this directory with appropriate permissions such that slapd can write to it.

You need to configure slapd so that you can connect to it as a directory user with permission to add entries. You can configure the directory to support a special super-user or root user just for this purpose. This is done through the following two options in the database definition:

        rootdn <dn>
        rootpw <passwd>

For example:

        rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
        rootpw secret

These options specify a DN and password that can be used to authenticate as the super-user entry of the database (i.e., the entry allowed to do anything). The DN and password specified here will always work, regardless of whether the entry named actually exists or has the password given. This solves the chicken-and-egg problem of how to authenticate and add entries before any entries yet exist.

Finally, you should make sure that the database definition contains the index definitions you want:

        index {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

For example, to index the cn, sn, uid and objectclass attributes, the following index directives could be used:

        index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
        index objectClass eq

This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the cn, sn, and uid attributes and an equality index for the objectClass attribute. Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types. See The slapd Configuration File section for more information on this option.

Once you have configured things to your liking, start up slapd, connect with your LDAP client, and start adding entries. For example, to add an organization entry and an organizational role entry using the ldapadd tool, you could create an LDIF file called entries.ldif with the contents:

        # Organization for Example Corporation
        dn: dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: dcObject
        objectClass: organization
        dc: example
        o: Example Corporation
        description: The Example Corporation
    
        # Organizational Role for Directory Manager
        dn: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: organizationalRole
        cn: Manager
        description: Directory Manager

and then use a command like this to actually create the entry:

        ldapadd -f entries.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret

The above command assumes settings provided in the above examples.
10.2. Creating a database off-line

The second method of database creation is to do it off-line, using the slapd database tools described below. This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an unacceptably long time to add using the LDAP method described above. These tools read the slapd configuration file and an input file containing a text representation of the entries to add. For database types which support the tools, they produce the database files directly (otherwise you must use the on-line method above). There are several important configuration options you will want to be sure and set in the config file database definition first:

        suffix <dn>

As described in the General Database Directives section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you are trying to create. For example:

        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:

        directory <directory>

For example:

        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data

Finally, you need to specify which indices you want to build. This is done by one or more index options.

        index {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

For example:

        index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
        index objectClass eq

This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the cn, sn, and uid attributes and an equality index for the objectClass attribute. Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types. See The slapd Configuration File section for more information on this option.
10.2.1. The slapadd program

Once you've configured things to your liking, you create the primary database and associated indices by running the slapadd(8) program:

        slapadd -l <inputfile> -f <slapdconfigfile>
                [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <integer>|-b <suffix>]

The arguments have the following meanings:

        -l <inputfile>

Specifies the LDIF input file containing the entries to add in text form (described below in the The LDIF text entry format section).

        -f <slapdconfigfile>

Specifies the slapd configuration file that tells where to create the indices, what indices to create, etc.

        -F <slapdconfdirectory>

Specifies a config directory. If both -f and -F are specified, the config file will be read and converted to config directory format and written to the specified directory. If neither option is specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config file is ignored. If dryrun mode is also specified, no conversion will occur.

        -d <debuglevel>

Turn on debugging, as specified by <debuglevel>. The debug levels are the same as for slapd. See the Command-Line Options section in Running slapd.

        -n <databasenumber>

An optional argument that specifies which database to modify. The first database listed in the configuration file is 1, the second 2, etc. By default, the first database in the configuration file is used. Should not be used in conjunction with -b.

        -b <suffix>

An optional argument that specifies which database to modify. The provided suffix is matched against a database suffix directive to determine the database number. Should not be used in conjunction with -n.
10.2.2. The slapindex program

Sometimes it may be necessary to regenerate indices (such as after modifying slapd.conf(5)). This is possible using the slapindex(8) program. slapindex is invoked like this

        slapindex -f <slapdconfigfile>
                [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <databasenumber>|-b <suffix>]

Where the -f, -d, -n and -b options are the same as for the slapadd(1) program. slapindex rebuilds all indices based upon the current database contents.
10.2.3. The slapcat program

The slapcat program is used to dump the database to an LDIF file. This can be useful when you want to make a human-readable backup of your database or when you want to edit your database off-line. The program is invoked like this:

        slapcat -l <filename> -f <slapdconfigfile>
                [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <databasenumber>|-b <suffix>]

where -n or -b is used to select the database in the slapd.conf(5) specified using -f. The corresponding LDIF output is written to standard output or to the file specified using the -l option.
10.3. The LDIF text entry format

The LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is used to represent LDAP entries in a simple text format. This section provides a brief description of the LDIF entry format which complements ldif(5) and the technical specification RFC2849.

The basic form of an entry is:

        # comment
        dn: <distinguished name>
        <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
        <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
    
        ...

Lines starting with a '#' character are comments. An attribute description may be a simple attribute type like cn or objectClass or 1.2.3 (an OID associated with an attribute type) or may include options such as cn;lang_en_US or userCertificate;binary.

A line may be continued by starting the next line with a single space or tab character. For example:

        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=
         com
        cn: Barbara J
          Jensen

is equivalent to:

        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Barbara J Jensen

Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines. e.g.,

        cn: Barbara J Jensen
        cn: Babs Jensen

If an <attrvalue> contains non-printing characters or begins with a space, a colon (':'), or a less than ('<'), the <attrdesc> is followed by a double colon and the base64 encoding of the value. For example, the value " begins with a space" would be encoded like this:

        cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=

You can also specify a URL containing the attribute value. For example, the following specifies the jpegPhoto value should be obtained from the file /path/to/file.jpeg.

        cn:< file:///path/to/file.jpeg

Multiple entries within the same LDIF file are separated by blank lines. Here's an example of an LDIF file containing three entries.

        # Barbara's Entry
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Barbara J Jensen
        cn: Babs Jensen
        objectClass: person
        sn: Jensen
    
        # Bjorn's Entry
        dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Bjorn J Jensen
        cn: Bjorn Jensen
        objectClass: person
        sn: Jensen
        # Base64 encoded JPEG photo
        jpegPhoto:: /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAAAAAQABAAD/2wBDABALD
         A4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQ
         ERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVG
    
        # Jennifer's Entry
        dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Jennifer J Jensen
        cn: Jennifer Jensen
        objectClass: person
        sn: Jensen
        # JPEG photo from file
        jpegPhoto:< file:///path/to/file.jpeg

Notice that the jpegPhoto in Bjorn's entry is base 64 encoded and the jpegPhoto in Jennifer's entry is obtained from the location indicated by the URL.

Note: Trailing spaces are not trimmed from values in an LDIF file. Nor are multiple internal spaces compressed. If you don't want them in your data, don't put them there.

11. Backends

Backends do the actual work of storing or retrieving data in response to LDAP requests. Backends may be compiled statically into slapd, or when module support is enabled, they may be dynamically loaded.

If your installation uses dynamic modules, you may need to add the relevant moduleload directives to the examples that follow. The name of the module for a backend is usually of the form:

        back_<backend name>.la

So for example, if you need to load the hdb backend, you would configure

        moduleload back_hdb.la

11.1. Berkeley DB Backends
11.1.1. Overview

The hdb backend to slapd(8) is a backend for a normal slapd database. It uses the Oracle Berkeley DB (BDB) package to store data. It makes extensive use of indexing and caching (see the Tuning section) to speed data access.

hdb is a variant of the original bdb backend which was first written for use with BDB. hdb uses a hierarchical database layout which supports subtree renames. It is otherwise identical to the bdb behavior, and all the same configuration options apply.

Note: An hdb database needs a large idlcachesize for good search performance, typically three times the cachesize (entry cache size) or larger.

Note: The hdb backend has superseded the bdb backend, and both will soon be deprecated in favor of the new mdb backend. See below.

11.1.2. back-bdb/back-hdb Configuration

11.1.3. Further Information

slapd-bdb(5)
11.2. LDAP
11.2.1. Overview

The LDAP backend to slapd(8) is not an actual database; instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming requests to another LDAP server. While processing requests it will also chase referrals, so that referrals are fully processed instead of being returned to the slapd client.

Sessions that explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database always create their own private connection to the remote LDAP server. Anonymous sessions will share a single anonymous connection to the remote server. For sessions bound through other mechanisms, all sessions with the same DN will share the same connection. This connection pooling strategy can enhance the proxy's efficiency by reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple connections.

The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e. the identity of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the remote server, possibly in some modified form. For this purpose, the proxy binds to the remote server with some administrative identity, and, if required, authorizes the asserted identity.

It is heavily used by a lot of other Backends and Overlays.
11.2.2. back-ldap Configuration

As previously mentioned, slapd-ldap(5) is used behind the scenes by many other Backends and Overlays. Some of them merely provide a few configuration directive themselves, but have available to the administrator the whole of the slapd-ldap(5) options.

For example, the Translucent Proxy, which retrieves entries from a remote LDAP server that can be partially overridden by the defined database, has only four specific translucent- directives, but can be configured using any of the normal slapd-ldap(5) options. See {[slapo-translucent(5)}} for details.

Other Overlays allow you to tag directives in front of a normal slapd-ldap(5) directive. For example, the slapo-chain(5) overlay does this:

"There are very few chain overlay specific directives; however, directives related to the instances of the ldap backend that may be implicitly instantiated by the overlay may assume a special meaning when used in conjunction with this overlay. They are described in slapd-ldap(5), and they also need to be prefixed by chain-."

You may have also seen the slapd-ldap(5) backend used and described in the Push Based Replication section of the guide.

It should therefore be obvious that the slapd-ldap(5) backend is extremely flexible and heavily used throughout the OpenLDAP Suite.

The following is a very simple example, but already the power of the slapd-ldap(5) backend is seen by use of a uri list:

        database        ldap
        suffix          "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn          "cn=slapd-ldap"
        uri             ldap://localhost/ ldap://remotehost ldap://remotehost2

The URI list is space or comma-separated. Whenever the server that responds is not the first one in the list, the list is rearranged and the responsive server is moved to the head, so that it will be first contacted the next time a connection needs be created.

This feature can be used to provide a form of load balancing when using MirrorMode replication.
11.2.3. Further Information

slapd-ldap(5)
11.3. LDIF
11.3.1. Overview

The LDIF backend to slapd(8) is a basic storage backend that stores entries in text files in LDIF format, and exploits the filesystem to create the tree structure of the database. It is intended as a cheap, low performance easy to use backend.

When using the cn=config dynamic configuration database with persistent storage, the configuration data is stored using this backend. See slapd-config(5) for more information
11.3.2. back-ldif Configuration

Like many other backends, the LDIF backend can be instantiated with very few configuration lines:

        include ./schema/core.schema
    
        database  ldif
        directory ./ldif
        suffix    "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn    "cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootpw    LDIF

If we add the dcObject for dc=suretecsystems,dc=com, you can see how this is added behind the scenes on the file system:

   dn: dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
   objectClass: dcObject
   objectClass: organization
   dc: suretecsystems
   o: Suretec Systems Ltd

Now we add it to the directory:

   ldapadd -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -f suretec.ldif -D "cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" -w LDIF
   adding new entry "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"

And inside ./ldif we have:

   ls ./ldif
   dc=suretecsystems,dc=com.ldif

which again contains:

   cat ldif/dc\=suretecsystems\,dc\=com.ldif

   dn: dc=suretecsystems
   objectClass: dcObject
   objectClass: organization
   dc: suretecsystems
   o: Suretec Systems Ltd.
   structuralObjectClass: organization
   entryUUID: 2134b714-e3a1-102c-9a15-f96ee263886d
   creatorsName: cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
   createTimestamp: 20080711142643Z
   entryCSN: 20080711142643.661124Z#000000#000#000000
   modifiersName: cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
   modifyTimestamp: 20080711142643Z

This is the complete format you would get when exporting your directory using slapcat etc.
11.3.3. Further Information

slapd-ldif(5)
11.4. LMDB
11.4.1. Overview

The mdb backend to slapd(8) is the recommended primary backend for a normal slapd database. It uses OpenLDAP's own Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) library to store data and is intended to replace the Berkeley DB backends.

It supports indexing like the BDB backends, but it uses no caching and requires no tuning to deliver maximum search performance. Like hdb, it is also fully hierarchical and supports subtree renames in constant time.
11.4.2. back-mdb Configuration

Unlike the BDB backends, the mdb backend can be instantiated with very few configuration lines:

        include ./schema/core.schema
    
        database  mdb
        directory ./mdb
        suffix    "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn    "cn=mdb,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootpw    mdb
        maxsize   1073741824

In addition to the usual parameters that a minimal configuration requires, the mdb backend requires a maximum size to be set. This should be the largest that the database is ever anticipated to grow (in bytes). The filesystem must also provide enough free space to accommodate this size.
11.4.3. Further Information

slapd-mdb(5)
11.5. Metadirectory
11.5.1. Overview

The meta backend to slapd(8) performs basic LDAP proxying with respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets". The information contained in these servers can be presented as belonging to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).

A basic knowledge of the functionality of the slapd-ldap(5) backend is recommended. This backend has been designed as an enhancement of the ldap backend. The two backends share many features (actually they also share portions of code). While the ldap backend is intended to proxy operations directed to a single server, the meta backend is mainly intended for proxying of multiple servers and possibly naming context masquerading.

These features, although useful in many scenarios, may result in excessive overhead for some applications, so its use should be carefully considered.
11.5.2. back-meta Configuration

LATER
11.5.3. Further Information

slapd-meta(5)
11.6. Monitor
11.6.1. Overview

The monitor backend to slapd(8) is not an actual database; if enabled, it is automatically generated and dynamically maintained by slapd with information about the running status of the daemon.

To inspect all monitor information, issue a subtree search with base cn=Monitor, requesting that attributes "+" and "*" are returned. The monitor backend produces mostly operational attributes, and LDAP only returns operational attributes that are explicitly requested. Requesting attribute "+" is an extension which requests all operational attributes.

See the Monitoring section.
11.6.2. back-monitor Configuration

The monitor database can be instantiated only once, i.e. only one occurrence of "database monitor" can occur in the slapd.conf(5) file. Also the suffix is automatically set to "cn=Monitor".

You can however set a rootdn and rootpw. The following is all that is needed to instantiate a monitor backend:

        include ./schema/core.schema
    
        database monitor
        rootdn "cn=monitoring,cn=Monitor"
        rootpw monitoring

You can also apply Access Control to this database like any other database, for example:

        access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"
             by dn.exact="uid=Admin,dc=my,dc=org" write
             by users read
             by * none

Note: The core.schema must be loaded for the monitor database to work.

A small example of the data returned via ldapsearch would be:

        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -b 'cn=Monitor'
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=Monitor> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #
    
        # Monitor
        dn: cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorServer
        cn: Monitor
        description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
        description: This object contains information about this server.
        description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
         must be explicitly requested.
    
        # Backends, Monitor
        dn: cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorContainer
        cn: Backends
        description: This subsystem contains information about available backends.

Please see the Monitoring section for complete examples of information available via this backend.
11.6.3. Further Information

slapd-monitor(5)
11.7. Null
11.7.1. Overview

The Null backend to slapd(8) is surely the most useful part of slapd:

    Searches return success but no entries.
    Compares return compareFalse.
    Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
    Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option "bind on" is given.
    The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are equally exciting.

Inspired by the /dev/null device.
11.7.2. back-null Configuration

This has to be one of the shortest configurations you'll ever do. In order to test this, your slapd.conf file would look like:

        database null
        suffix "cn=Nothing"
        bind on

bind on means:

"Allow binds as any DN in this backend's suffix, with any password. The default is "off"."

To test this backend with ldapsearch:

        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -D "uid=none,cn=Nothing" -w testing -b 'cn=Nothing'
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=Nothing> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #
    
        # search result
        search: 2
        result: 0 Success
    
        # numResponses: 1

11.7.3. Further Information

slapd-null(5)
11.8. Passwd
11.8.1. Overview

The PASSWD backend to slapd(8) serves up the user account information listed in the system passwd(5) file (defaulting to /etc/passwd).

This backend is provided for demonstration purposes only. The DN of each entry is "uid=<username>,<suffix>".
11.8.2. back-passwd Configuration

The configuration using slapd.conf a slightly longer, but not much. For example:

        include ./schema/core.schema
    
        database passwd
        suffix "cn=passwd"

Again, testing this with ldapsearch would result in something like:

        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -b 'cn=passwd'
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=passwd> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #
    
        # passwd
        dn: cn=passwd
        cn: passwd
        objectClass: organizationalUnit
    
        # root, passwd
        dn: uid=root,cn=passwd
        objectClass: person
        objectClass: uidObject
        uid: root
        cn: root
        sn: root
        description: root

11.8.3. Further Information

slapd-passwd(5)
11.9. Perl/Shell
11.9.1. Overview

The Perl backend to slapd(8) works by embedding a perl(1) interpreter into slapd(8). Any perl database section of the configuration file slapd.conf(5) must then specify what Perl module to use. Slapd then creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that particular instance of the backend.

The Shell backend to slapd(8) executes external programs to implement operations, and is designed to make it easy to tie an existing database to the slapd front-end. This backend is is primarily intended to be used in prototypes.

11.10. Relay
11.10.1. Overview

The primary purpose of this slapd(8) backend is to map a naming context defined in a database running in the same slapd(8) instance into a virtual naming context, with attributeType and objectClass manipulation, if required. It requires the rwm overlay.

This backend and the above mentioned overlay are experimental.
11.10.2. back-relay Configuration

LATER
11.10.3. Further Information

slapd-relay(5)
11.11. SQL
11.11.1. Overview

The primary purpose of this slapd(8) backend is to PRESENT information stored in some RDBMS as an LDAP subtree without any programming (some SQL and maybe stored procedures can't be considered programming, anyway ;).

That is, for example, when you (some ISP) have account information you use in an RDBMS, and want to use modern solutions that expect such information in LDAP (to authenticate users, make email lookups etc.). Or you want to synchronize or distribute information between different sites/applications that use RDBMSes and/or LDAP. Or whatever else...

It is NOT designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS instead of BerkeleyDB (as the standard BDB backend does), though it can be used as such with several limitations. Please see LDAP vs RDBMS for discussion.

The idea is to use some meta-information to translate LDAP queries to SQL queries, leaving relational schema untouched, so that old applications can continue using it without any modifications. This allows SQL and LDAP applications to interoperate without replication, and exchange data as needed.

The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational schema without having to change source (through that meta-information mentioned). Also, it uses ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and is highly configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes may use, so it may be used for integration and distribution of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environments.

This backend is experimental.
11.11.2. back-sql Configuration

This backend has to be one of the most abused and complex backends there is. Therefore, we will go through a simple, small example that comes with the OpenLDAP source and can be found in servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/README

For this example we will be using PostgreSQL.

First, we add to /etc/odbc.ini a block of the form:

        [example]                        <===
        Description         = Example for OpenLDAP's back-sql
        Driver              = PostgreSQL
        Trace               = No
        Database            = example    <===
        Servername          = localhost
        UserName            = manager    <===
        Password            = secret     <===
        Port                = 5432
        ;Protocol            = 6.4
        ReadOnly            = No
        RowVersioning       = No
        ShowSystemTables    = No
        ShowOidColumn       = No
        FakeOidIndex        = No
        ConnSettings        =

The relevant information for our test setup is highlighted with '<===' on the right above.

Next, we add to /etc/odbcinst.ini a block of the form:

        [PostgreSQL]
        Description     = ODBC for PostgreSQL
        Driver          = /usr/lib/libodbcpsql.so
        Setup           = /usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so
        FileUsage       = 1

We will presume you know how to create a database and user in PostgreSQL and how to set a password. Also, we'll presume you can populate the 'example' database you've just created with the following files, as found in servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/pgsql

        backsql_create.sql, testdb_create.sql, testdb_data.sql, testdb_metadata.sql

Lastly, run the test:

        [root@localhost]# cd $SOURCES/tests
        [root@localhost]# SLAPD_USE_SQL=pgsql ./run sql-test000

Briefly, you should see something like (cut short for space):

        Cleaning up test run directory leftover from previous run.
        Running ./scripts/sql-test000-read...
        running defines.sh
        Starting slapd on TCP/IP port 9011...
        Testing SQL backend read operations...
        Waiting 5 seconds for slapd to start...
        Testing correct bind... dn:cn=Mitya Kovalev,dc=example,dc=com
        Testing incorrect bind (should fail)... ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)
    
        ......
    
        Filtering original ldif...
        Comparing filter output...
        >>>>> Test succeeded

The test is basically readonly; this can be performed by all RDBMSes (listed above).

There is another test, sql-test900-write, which is currently enabled only for PostgreSQL and IBM db2.

Using sql-test000, files in servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/pgsql/ and the man page, you should be set.

Note: This backend is experimental.

12. Overlays

Overlays are software components that provide hooks to functions analogous to those provided by backends, which can be stacked on top of the backend calls and as callbacks on top of backend responses to alter their behavior.

Overlays may be compiled statically into slapd, or when module support is enabled, they may be dynamically loaded. Most of the overlays are only allowed to be configured on individual databases.

Some can be stacked on the frontend as well, for global use. This means that they can be executed after a request is parsed and validated, but right before the appropriate database is selected. The main purpose is to affect operations regardless of the database they will be handled by, and, in some cases, to influence the selection of the database by massaging the request DN.

Essentially, overlays represent a means to:

    customize the behavior of existing backends without changing the backend code and without requiring one to write a new custom backend with complete functionality
    write functionality of general usefulness that can be applied to different backend types

When using slapd.conf(5), overlays that are configured before any other databases are considered global, as mentioned above. In fact they are implicitly stacked on top of the frontend database. They can also be explicitly configured as such:

        database frontend
        overlay <overlay name>

Overlays are usually documented by separate specific man pages in section 5; the naming convention is

        slapo-<overlay name>

All distributed core overlays have a man page. Feel free to contribute to any, if you think there is anything missing in describing the behavior of the component and the implications of all the related configuration directives.

Official overlays are located in

        servers/slapd/overlays/

That directory also contains the file slapover.txt, which describes the rationale of the overlay implementation, and may serve as a guideline for the development of custom overlays.

Contribware overlays are located in

        contrib/slapd-modules/<overlay name>/

along with other types of run-time loadable components; they are officially distributed, but not maintained by the project.

All the current overlays in OpenLDAP are listed and described in detail in the following sections.
12.1. Access Logging
12.1.1. Overview

This overlay can record accesses to a given backend database on another database.

This allows all of the activity on a given database to be reviewed using arbitrary LDAP queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files. Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log records from the logging database. Log records are stored with audit schema to assure their readability whether viewed as LDIF or in raw form.

It is also used for delta-syncrepl replication
12.1.2. Access Logging Configuration

The following is a basic example that implements Access Logging:

        database bdb
        suffix dc=example,dc=com
        ...
        overlay accesslog
        logdb cn=log
        logops writes reads
        logold (objectclass=person)
    
        database bdb
        suffix cn=log
        ...
        index reqStart eq
        access to *
          by dn.base="cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" read

The following is an example used for delta-syncrepl replication:

        database hdb
        suffix cn=accesslog
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-accesslog
        rootdn cn=accesslog
        index default eq
        index entryCSN,objectClass,reqEnd,reqResult,reqStart

Accesslog overlay definitions for the primary db

        database bdb
        suffix dc=example,dc=com
        ...
        overlay accesslog
        logdb cn=accesslog
        logops writes
        logsuccess TRUE
        # scan the accesslog DB every day, and purge entries older than 7 days
        logpurge 07+00:00 01+00:00

An example search result against cn=accesslog might look like:

        [ghenry@suretec ghenry]# ldapsearch -x -b cn=accesslog
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=accesslog> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #
    
        # accesslog
        dn: cn=accesslog
        objectClass: auditContainer
        cn: accesslog
    
        # 20080110163829.000004Z, accesslog
        dn: reqStart=20080110163829.000004Z,cn=accesslog
        objectClass: auditModify
        reqStart: 20080110163829.000004Z

12.2. Audit Logging

The Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a given backend database to a specified log file.
12.2.1. Overview

If the need arises whereby changes need to be logged as standard LDIF, then the auditlog overlay slapo-auditlog (5) can be used. Full examples are available in the man page slapo-auditlog (5)
12.2.2. Audit Logging Configuration

If the directory is running vi slapd.d, then the following LDIF could be used to add the overlay to the overlay list in cn=config and set what file the LDIF gets logged to (adjust to suit)

       dn: olcOverlay=auditlog,olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
       changetype: add
       objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
       objectClass: olcAuditLogConfig
       olcOverlay: auditlog
       olcAuditlogFile: /tmp/auditlog.ldif

In this example for testing, we are logging changes to /tmp/auditlog.ldif

A typical LDIF file created by slapo-auditlog(5) would look like:

       # add 1196797576 dc=suretecsystems,dc=com cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       dn: dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       changetype: add
       objectClass: dcObject
       objectClass: organization
       dc: suretecsystems
       o: Suretec Systems Ltd.
       structuralObjectClass: organization
       entryUUID: 1606f8f8-f06e-1029-8289-f0cc9d81e81a
       creatorsName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com

12.3. Chaining
12.3.1. Overview

The chain overlay provides basic chaining capability to the underlying database.

What is chaining? It indicates the capability of a DSA to follow referrals on behalf of the client, so that distributed systems are viewed as a single virtual DSA by clients that are otherwise unable to "chase" (i.e. follow) referrals by themselves.

The chain overlay is built on top of the ldap backend; it is compiled by default when --enable-ldap.
12.3.2. Chaining Configuration

In order to demonstrate how this overlay works, we shall discuss a typical scenario which might be one master server and three Syncrepl slaves.

On each replica, add this near the top of the slapd.conf(5) file (global), before any database definitions:

        overlay                    chain
        chain-uri                  "ldap://ldapmaster.example.com"
        chain-idassert-bind        bindmethod="simple"
                                   binddn="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
                                   credentials="<secret>"
                                   mode="self"
        chain-tls                  start
        chain-return-error         TRUE

Add this below your syncrepl statement:

        updateref                  "ldap://ldapmaster.example.com/"

The chain-tls statement enables TLS from the slave to the ldap master. The DITs are exactly the same between these machines, therefore whatever user bound to the slave will also exist on the master. If that DN does not have update privileges on the master, nothing will happen.

You will need to restart the slave after these slapd.conf changes. Then, if you are using loglevel stats (256), you can monitor an ldapmodify on the slave and the master. (If you're using cn=config no restart is required.)

Now start an ldapmodify on the slave and watch the logs. You should expect something like:

        Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 ACCEPT from IP=143.199.102.216:45181 (IP=143.199.102.216:389)
        Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=0 STARTTLS
        Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=0 RESULT oid= err=0 text=
        Sep  6 09:27:25 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 TLS established tls_ssf=256 ssf=256
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 BIND dn="uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" method=128
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 BIND dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" mech=SIMPLE ssf=0
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 RESULT tag=97 err=0 text=
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 MOD dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 MOD attr=mail
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 RESULT tag=103 err=0 text=
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=3 UNBIND
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 closed
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: LDAP_RES_SEARCH_ENTRY(LDAP_SYNC_MODIFY)
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: be_search (0)
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        Sep  6 09:27:28 slave1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: be_modify (0)

And on the master you will see this:

        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 PROXYAUTHZ dn="uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 MOD dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 MOD attr=mail
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapmaster slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 RESULT tag=103 err=0 text=

Note: You can clearly see the PROXYAUTHZ line on the master, indicating the proper identity assertion for the update on the master. Also note the slave immediately receiving the Syncrepl update from the master.

12.3.3. Handling Chaining Errors

By default, if chaining fails, the original referral is returned to the client under the assumption that the client might want to try and follow the referral.

With the following directive however, if the chaining fails at the provider side, the actual error is returned to the client.

        chain-return-error TRUE

12.3.4. Read-Back of Chained Modifications

Occasionally, applications want to read back the data that they just wrote. If a modification requested to a shadow server was silently chained to its provider, an immediate read could result in receiving data not yet synchronized. In those cases, clients should use the dontusecopy control to ensure they are directed to the authoritative source for that piece of data.

This control usually causes a referral to the actual source of the data to be returned. However, when the slapo-chain(5) overlay is used, it intercepts the referral being returned in response to the dontusecopy control, and tries to fetch the requested data.

12.4. Constraints
12.4.1. Overview

This overlay enforces a regular expression constraint on all values of specified attributes during an LDAP modify request that contains add or modify commands. It is used to enforce a more rigorous syntax when the underlying attribute syntax is too general.
12.4.2. Constraint Configuration

Configuration via slapd.conf(5) would look like:

        overlay constraint
        constraint_attribute mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
        constraint_attribute title uri
        ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)

A specification like the above would reject any mail attribute which did not look like <alpha-numeric string>@mydomain.com.

It would also reject any title attribute whose values were not listed in the title attribute of any titleCatalog entries in the given scope.

An example for use with cn=config:

       dn: olcOverlay=constraint,olcDatabase={1}hdb,cn=config
       changetype: add
       objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
       objectClass: olcConstraintConfig
       olcOverlay: constraint
       olcConstraintAttribute: mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
       olcConstraintAttribute: title uri ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)

slapo-constraint(5)
12.5. Dynamic Directory Services
12.5.1. Overview

The dds overlay to slapd(8) implements dynamic objects as per RFC2589. The name dds stands for Dynamic Directory Services. It allows to define dynamic objects, characterized by the dynamicObject objectClass.

Dynamic objects have a limited lifetime, determined by a time-to-live (TTL) that can be refreshed by means of a specific refresh extended operation. This operation allows to set the Client Refresh Period (CRP), namely the period between refreshes that is required to preserve the dynamic object from expiration. The expiration time is computed by adding the requested TTL to the current time. When dynamic objects reach the end of their lifetime without being further refreshed, they are automatically deleted. There is no guarantee of immediate deletion, so clients should not count on it.
12.5.2. Dynamic Directory Service Configuration

A usage of dynamic objects might be to implement dynamic meetings; in this case, all the participants to the meeting are allowed to refresh the meeting object, but only the creator can delete it (otherwise it will be deleted when the TTL expires).

If we add the overlay to an example database, specifying a Max TTL of 1 day, a min of 10 seconds, with a default TTL of 1 hour. We'll also specify an interval of 120 (less than 60s might be too small) seconds between expiration checks and a tolerance of 5 second (lifetime of a dynamic object will be entryTtl + tolerance).

       overlay dds
       dds-max-ttl     1d
       dds-min-ttl     10s
       dds-default-ttl 1h
       dds-interval    120s
       dds-tolerance   5s

and add an index:

       entryExpireTimestamp

Creating a meeting is as simple as adding the following:

       dn: cn=OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting,ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com
       objectClass: groupOfNames
       objectClass: dynamicObject
       cn: OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting
       member: uid=ghenry,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
       member: uid=hyc,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

12.5.2.1. Dynamic Directory Service ACLs

Allow users to start a meeting and to join it; restrict refresh to the member; restrict delete to the creator:

       access to attrs=userPassword
          by self write
          by * read
    
       access to dn.base="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=children
            by users write
    
       access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=entry
            by dnattr=creatorsName write
            by * read
    
       access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=participant
            by dnattr=creatorsName write
            by users selfwrite
            by * read
    
       access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=entryTtl
            by dnattr=member manage
            by * read

In simple terms, the user who created the OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting can add new attendees, refresh the meeting using (basically complete control):

       ldapexop -x -H ldap://ldaphost "refresh" "cn=OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting,ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com" "120" -D "uid=ghenry,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -W

Any user can join the meeting, but not add another attendee, but they can refresh the meeting. The ACLs above are quite straight forward to understand.

12.6. Dynamic Groups
12.6.1. Overview

This overlay extends the Compare operation to detect members of a dynamic group. This overlay is now deprecated as all of its functions are available using the Dynamic Lists overlay.
12.6.2. Dynamic Group Configuration
12.7. Dynamic Lists
12.7.1. Overview

This overlay allows expansion of dynamic groups and lists. Instead of having the group members or list attributes hard coded, this overlay allows us to define an LDAP search whose results will make up the group or list.
12.7.2. Dynamic List Configuration

This module can behave both as a dynamic list and dynamic group, depending on the configuration. The syntax is as follows:

       overlay dynlist
       dynlist-attrset <group-oc> <URL-ad> [member-ad]

The parameters to the dynlist-attrset directive have the following meaning:

    <group-oc>: specifies which object class triggers the subsequent LDAP search. Whenever an entry with this object class is retrieved, the search is performed.
    <URL-ad>: is the name of the attribute which holds the search URI. It has to be a subtype of labeledURI. The attributes and values present in the search result are added to the entry unless member-ad is used (see below).
    member-ad: if present, changes the overlay behavior into a dynamic group. Instead of inserting the results of the search in the entry, the distinguished name of the results are added as values of this attribute.

Here is an example which will allow us to have an email alias which automatically expands to all user's emails according to our LDAP filter:

In slapd.conf(5):

       overlay dynlist
       dynlist-attrset nisMailAlias labeledURI

This means that whenever an entry which has the nisMailAlias object class is retrieved, the search specified in the labeledURI attribute is performed.

Let's say we have this entry in our directory:

       cn=all,ou=aliases,dc=example,dc=com
       cn: all
       objectClass: nisMailAlias
       labeledURI: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?one?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

If this entry is retrieved, the search specified in labeledURI will be performed and the results will be added to the entry just as if they have always been there. In this case, the search filter selects all entries directly under ou=People that have the inetOrgPerson object class and retrieves the mail attribute, if it exists.

This is what gets added to the entry when we have two users under ou=People that match the filter:

Figure X.Y: Dynamic List for all emails

The configuration for a dynamic group is similar. Let's see an example which would automatically populate an allusers group with all the user accounts in the directory.

In slapd.conf(5):

       include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
       ...
       overlay dynlist
       dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs labeledURI member
    
    Note: We must include the dyngroup.schema file that defines the
    groupOfURLs objectClass used in this example.

Let's apply it to the following entry:

       cn=allusers,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
       cn: all
       objectClass: groupOfURLs
       labeledURI: ldap:///ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

The behavior is similar to the dynamic list configuration we had before: whenever an entry with the groupOfURLs object class is retrieved, the search specified in the labeledURI attribute is performed. But this time, only the distinguished names of the results are added, and as values of the member attribute.

This is what we get:

Figure X.Y: Dynamic Group for all users

Note that a side effect of this scheme of dynamic groups is that the members need to be specified as full DNs. So, if you are planning in using this for posixGroups, be sure to use RFC2307bis and some attribute which can hold distinguished names. The memberUid attribute used in the posixGroup object class can hold only names, not DNs, and is therefore not suitable for dynamic groups.

slapo-dynlist(5)
12.8. Reverse Group Membership Maintenance
12.8.1. Overview

In some scenarios, it may be desirable for a client to be able to determine which groups an entry is a member of, without performing an additional search. Examples of this are applications using the DIT for access control based on group authorization.

The memberof overlay updates an attribute (by default memberOf) whenever changes occur to the membership attribute (by default member) of entries of the objectclass (by default groupOfNames) configured to trigger updates.

Thus, it provides maintenance of the list of groups an entry is a member of, when usual maintenance of groups is done by modifying the members on the group entry.
12.8.2. Member Of Configuration

The typical use of this overlay requires just enabling the overlay for a specific database. For example, with the following minimal slapd.conf:

        include /usr/share/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include /usr/share/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
    
        authz-regexp "gidNumber=0\\\+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth"
                "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
        database        bdb
        suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
        rootdn          "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
        rootpw          secret
        directory       /var/lib/ldap2.4
        checkpoint 256 5
        index   objectClass   eq
        index   uid           eq,sub
    
        overlay memberof

adding the following ldif:

        cat memberof.ldif
        dn: dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: domain
        dc: example
    
        dn: ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: organizationalUnit
        ou: Group
    
        dn: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: organizationalUnit
        ou: People
    
        dn: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: account
        uid: test1
    
        dn: cn=testgroup,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: groupOfNames
        cn: testgroup
        member: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

Results in the following output from a search on the test1 user:

 # ldapsearch -LL -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// "(uid=test1)" -b dc=example,dc=com memberOf
 SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started
 SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
 SASL SSF: 0
 version: 1

 dn: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
 memberOf: cn=testgroup,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com

Note that the memberOf attribute is an operational attribute, so it must be requested explicitly.

12.9. The Proxy Cache Engine

LDAP servers typically hold one or more subtrees of a DIT. Replica (or shadow) servers hold shadow copies of entries held by one or more master servers. Changes are propagated from the master server to replica (slave) servers using LDAP Sync replication. An LDAP cache is a special type of replica which holds entries corresponding to search filters instead of subtrees.
12.9.1. Overview

The proxy cache extension of slapd is designed to improve the responsiveness of the ldap and meta backends. It handles a search request (query) by first determining whether it is contained in any cached search filter. Contained requests are answered from the proxy cache's local database. Other requests are passed on to the underlying ldap or meta backend and processed as usual.

E.g. (shoesize>=9) is contained in (shoesize>=8) and (sn=Richardson) is contained in (sn=Richards*)

Correct matching rules and syntaxes are used while comparing assertions for query containment. To simplify the query containment problem, a list of cacheable "templates" (defined below) is specified at configuration time. A query is cached or answered only if it belongs to one of these templates. The entries corresponding to cached queries are stored in the proxy cache local database while its associated meta information (filter, scope, base, attributes) is stored in main memory.

A template is a prototype for generating LDAP search requests. Templates are described by a prototype search filter and a list of attributes which are required in queries generated from the template. The representation for prototype filter is similar to RFC4515, except that the assertion values are missing. Examples of prototype filters are: (sn=),(&(sn=)(givenname=)) which are instantiated by search filters (sn=Doe) and (&(sn=Doe)(givenname=John)) respectively.

The cache replacement policy removes the least recently used (LRU) query and entries belonging to only that query. Queries are allowed a maximum time to live (TTL) in the cache thus providing weak consistency. A background task periodically checks the cache for expired queries and removes them.

The Proxy Cache paper (http://www.openldap.org/pub/kapurva/proxycaching.pdf) provides design and implementation details.
12.9.2. Proxy Cache Configuration

The cache configuration specific directives described below must appear after a overlay pcache directive within a "database meta" or "database ldap" section of the server's slapd.conf(5) file.
12.9.2.1. Setting cache parameters

 pcache <DB> <maxentries> <nattrsets> <entrylimit> <period>

This directive enables proxy caching and sets general cache parameters. The <DB> parameter specifies which underlying database is to be used to hold cached entries. It should be set to bdb or hdb. The <maxentries> parameter specifies the total number of entries which may be held in the cache. The <nattrsets> parameter specifies the total number of attribute sets (as specified by the pcacheAttrset directive) that may be defined. The <entrylimit> parameter specifies the maximum number of entries in a cacheable query. The <period> specifies the consistency check period (in seconds). In each period, queries with expired TTLs are removed.
12.9.2.2. Defining attribute sets

 pcacheAttrset <index> <attrs...>

Used to associate a set of attributes to an index. Each attribute set is associated with an index number from 0 to <numattrsets>-1. These indices are used by the pcacheTemplate directive to define cacheable templates.
12.9.2.3. Specifying cacheable templates

 pcacheTemplate <prototype_string> <attrset_index> <TTL>

Specifies a cacheable template and the "time to live" (in sec) <TTL> for queries belonging to the template. A template is described by its prototype filter string and set of required attributes identified by <attrset_index>.
12.9.2.4. Example for slapd.conf

An example slapd.conf(5) database section for a caching server which proxies for the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree held at server ldap.example.com.

12.9.2.5. Example for slapd-config

The same example as a LDIF file for back-config for a caching server which proxies for the "dc=example,dc=com" subtree held at server ldap.example.com.

   dn: olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
   objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
   objectClass: olcLDAPConfig
   olcDatabase: {2}ldap
   olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
   olcRootDN: dc=example,dc=com
   olcDbURI: "ldap://ldap.example.com"

   dn: olcOverlay={0}pcache,olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
   objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
   objectClass: olcPcacheConfig
   olcOverlay: {0}pcache
   olcPcache: hdb 100000 1 1000 100
   olcPcacheAttrset: 0 mail postalAddress telephoneNumber
   olcPcacheTemplate: "(sn=)" 0 3600 0 0 0
   olcPcacheTemplate: "(&(sn=)(givenName=))" 0 3600 0 0 0

   olcDbDirectory: ./testrun/db.2.a
   olcDbCacheSize: 20
   olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
   olcDbIndex: cn,sn,uid,mail  pres,eq,sub

12.9.2.5.1. Cacheable Queries

A LDAP search query is cacheable when its filter matches one of the templates as defined in the "pcacheTemplate" statements and when it references only the attributes specified in the corresponding attribute set. In the example above the attribute set number 0 defines that only the attributes: mail postaladdress telephonenumber are cached for the following pcacheTemplates.
12.9.2.5.2. Examples:

        Filter: (&(sn=Richard*)(givenName=jack))
        Attrs: mail telephoneNumber

is cacheable, because it matches the template (&(sn=)(givenName=)) and its attributes are contained in pcacheAttrset 0.

        Filter: (&(sn=Richard*)(telephoneNumber))
        Attrs: givenName

is not cacheable, because the filter does not match the template, nor is the attribute givenName stored in the cache

        Filter: (|(sn=Richard*)(givenName=jack))
        Attrs: mail telephoneNumber

is not cacheable, because the filter does not match the template ( logical OR "|" condition instead of logical AND "&" )

12.10. Password Policies
12.10.1. Overview

This overlay follows the specifications contained in the draft RFC titled draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-09. While the draft itself is expired, it has been implemented in several directory servers, including slapd. Nonetheless, it is important to note that it is a draft, meaning that it is subject to change and is a work-in-progress.

The key abilities of the password policy overlay are as follows:

    Enforce a minimum length for new passwords
    Make sure passwords are not changed too frequently
    Cause passwords to expire, provide warnings before they need to be changed, and allow a fixed number of 'grace' logins to allow them to be changed after they have expired
    Maintain a history of passwords to prevent password re-use
    Prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures
    Force a password to be changed at the next authentication
    Set an administrative lock on an account
    Support multiple password policies on a default or a per-object basis.
    Perform arbitrary quality checks using an external loadable module. This is a non-standard extension of the draft RFC.

12.10.2. Password Policy Configuration

Instantiate the module in the database where it will be used, after adding the new ppolicy schema and loading the ppolicy module. The following example shows the ppolicy module being added to the database that handles the naming context "dc=example,dc=com". In this example we are also specifying the DN of a policy object to use if none other is specified in a user's object.

       database bdb
       suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
       [...additional database configuration directives go here...]
    
       overlay ppolicy
       ppolicy_default "cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com"

Now we need a container for the policy objects. In our example the password policy objects are going to be placed in a section of the tree called "ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com":

       dn: ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com
       objectClass: organizationalUnit
       objectClass: top
       ou: policies

The default policy object that we are creating defines the following policies:

    The user is allowed to change his own password. Note that the directory ACLs for this attribute can also affect this ability (pwdAllowUserChange: TRUE).
    The name of the password attribute is "userPassword" (pwdAttribute: userPassword). Note that this is the only value that is accepted by OpenLDAP for this attribute.
    The server will check the syntax of the password. If the server is unable to check the syntax (i.e., it was hashed or otherwise encoded by the client) it will return an error refusing the password (pwdCheckQuality: 2).
    When a client includes the Password Policy Request control with a bind request, the server will respond with a password expiration warning if it is going to expire in ten minutes or less (pwdExpireWarning: 600). The warnings themselves are returned in a Password Policy Response control.
    When the password for a DN has expired, the server will allow five additional "grace" logins (pwdGraceAuthNLimit: 5).
    The server will maintain a history of the last five passwords that were used for a DN (pwdInHistory: 5).
    The server will lock the account after the maximum number of failed bind attempts has been exceeded (pwdLockout: TRUE).
    When the server has locked an account, the server will keep it locked until an administrator unlocks it (pwdLockoutDuration: 0)
    The server will reset its failed bind count after a period of 30 seconds.
    Passwords will not expire (pwdMaxAge: 0).
    Passwords can be changed as often as desired (pwdMinAge: 0).
    Passwords must be at least 5 characters in length (pwdMinLength: 5).
    The password does not need to be changed at the first bind or when the administrator has reset the password (pwdMustChange: FALSE)
    The current password does not need to be included with password change requests (pwdSafeModify: FALSE)
    The server will only allow five failed binds in a row for a particular DN (pwdMaxFailure: 5).

The actual policy would be:

       dn: cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com
       cn: default
       objectClass: pwdPolicy
       objectClass: person
       objectClass: top
       pwdAllowUserChange: TRUE
       pwdAttribute: userPassword
       pwdCheckQuality: 2
       pwdExpireWarning: 600
       pwdFailureCountInterval: 30
       pwdGraceAuthNLimit: 5
       pwdInHistory: 5
       pwdLockout: TRUE
       pwdLockoutDuration: 0
       pwdMaxAge: 0
       pwdMaxFailure: 5
       pwdMinAge: 0
       pwdMinLength: 5
       pwdMustChange: FALSE
       pwdSafeModify: FALSE
       sn: dummy value

You can create additional policy objects as needed.

There are two ways password policy can be applied to individual objects:

1. The pwdPolicySubentry in a user's object - If a user's object has a pwdPolicySubEntry attribute specifying the DN of a policy object, then the policy defined by that object is applied.

2. Default password policy - If there is no specific pwdPolicySubentry set for an object, and the password policy module was configured with the DN of a default policy object and if that object exists, then the policy defined in that object is applied.

12.11. Referential Integrity
12.11.1. Overview

This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to maintain the cohesiveness of a schema which utilizes reference attributes.

Whenever a modrdn or delete is performed, that is, when an entry's DN is renamed or an entry is removed, the server will search the directory for references to this DN (in selected attributes: see below) and update them accordingly. If it was a delete operation, the reference is deleted. If it was a modrdn operation, then the reference is updated with the new DN.

For example, a very common administration task is to maintain group membership lists, specially when users are removed from the directory. When an user account is deleted or renamed, all groups this user is a member of have to be updated. LDAP administrators usually have scripts for that. But we can use the refint overlay to automate this task. In this example, if the user is removed from the directory, the overlay will take care to remove the user from all the groups he/she was a member of. No more scripting for this.
12.11.2. Referential Integrity Configuration

The configuration for this overlay is as follows:

       overlay refint
       refint_attributes <attribute [attribute ...]>
       refint_nothing <string>
    
    refint_attributes: this parameter specifies a space separated list of attributes which will have the referential integrity maintained. When an entry is removed or has its DN renamed, the server will do an internal search for any of the refint_attributes that point to the affected DN and update them accordingly. IMPORTANT: the attributes listed here must have the distinguishedName syntax, that is, hold DNs as values.
    refint_nothing: some times, while trying to maintain the referential integrity, the server has to remove the last attribute of its kind from an entry. This may be prohibited by the schema: for example, the groupOfNames object class requires at least one member. In these cases, the server will add the attribute value specified in refint_nothing to the entry.

To illustrate this overlay, we will use the group membership scenario.

In slapd.conf:

       overlay refint
       refint_attributes member
       refint_nothing "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"

This configuration tells the overlay to maintain the referential integrity of the member attribute. This attribute is used in the groupOfNames object class which always needs a member, so we add the refint_nothing directive to fill in the group with a standard member should all the members vanish.

If we have the following group membership, the refint overlay will automatically remove john from the group if his entry is removed from the directory:

Figure X.Y: Maintaining referential integrity in groups

Notice that if we rename (modrdn) the john entry to, say, jsmith, the refint overlay will also rename the reference in the member attribute, so the group membership stays correct.

If we removed all users from the directory who are a member of this group, then the end result would be a single member in the group: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com. This is the refint_nothing parameter kicking into action so that the schema is not violated.

The rootdn must be set for the database as refint runs as the rootdn to gain access to make its updates. The rootpw does not need to be set.

12.12. Return Code
12.12.1. Overview

This overlay is useful to test the behavior of clients when server-generated erroneous and/or unusual responses occur, for example; error codes, referrals, excessive response times and so on.

This would be classed as a debugging tool whilst developing client software or additional Overlays.

For detailed information, please see the slapo-retcode(5) man page.
12.12.2. Return Code Configuration

The retcode overlay utilizes the "return code" schema described in the man page. This schema is specifically designed for use with this overlay and is not intended to be used otherwise.

Note: The necessary schema is loaded automatically by the overlay.

An example configuration might be:

       overlay         retcode
       retcode-parent  "ou=RetCodes,dc=example,dc=com"
       include         ./retcode.conf
    
       retcode-item    "cn=Unsolicited"                0x00 unsolicited="0"
       retcode-item    "cn=Notice of Disconnect"       0x00 unsolicited="1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20036"
       retcode-item    "cn=Pre-disconnect"             0x34 flags="pre-disconnect"
       retcode-item    "cn=Post-disconnect"            0x34 flags="post-disconnect"

Note: retcode.conf can be found in the openldap source at: tests/data/retcode.conf

An excerpt of a retcode.conf would be something like:

       retcode-item    "cn=success"                            0x00
    
       retcode-item    "cn=success w/ delay"                   0x00    sleeptime=2
    
       retcode-item    "cn=operationsError"                    0x01
       retcode-item    "cn=protocolError"                      0x02
       retcode-item    "cn=timeLimitExceeded"                  0x03    op=search
       retcode-item    "cn=sizeLimitExceeded"                  0x04    op=search
       retcode-item    "cn=compareFalse"                       0x05    op=compare
       retcode-item    "cn=compareTrue"                        0x06    op=compare
       retcode-item    "cn=authMethodNotSupported"             0x07
       retcode-item    "cn=strongAuthNotSupported"             0x07    text="same as authMethodNotSupported"
       retcode-item    "cn=strongAuthRequired"                 0x08
       retcode-item    "cn=strongerAuthRequired"               0x08    text="same as strongAuthRequired"

12.13. Rewrite/Remap
12.13.1. Overview

It performs basic DN/data rewrite and objectClass/attributeType mapping. Its usage is mostly intended to provide virtual views of existing data either remotely, in conjunction with the proxy backend described in slapd-ldap(5), or locally, in conjunction with the relay backend described in slapd-relay(5).

This overlay is extremely configurable and advanced, therefore recommended reading is the slapo-rwm(5) man page.

12.14. Sync Provider
12.14.1. Overview

This overlay implements the provider-side support for the LDAP Content Synchronization (RFC4533) as well as syncrepl replication support, including persistent search functionality.
12.14.2. Sync Provider Configuration

There is very little configuration needed for this overlay, in fact for many situations merely loading the overlay will suffice.

However, because the overlay creates a contextCSN attribute in the root entry of the database which is updated for every write operation performed against the database and only updated in memory, it is recommended to configure a checkpoint so that the contextCSN is written into the underlying database to minimize recovery time after an unclean shutdown:

       overlay syncprov
       syncprov-checkpoint 100 10

For every 100 operations or 10 minutes, which ever is sooner, the contextCSN will be checkpointed.

The four configuration directives available are syncprov-checkpoint, syncprov-sessionlog, syncprov-nopresent and syncprov-reloadhint which are covered in the man page discussing various other scenarios where this overlay can be used.

12.15. Translucent Proxy
12.15.1. Overview

This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to create a "translucent proxy".

Entries retrieved from a remote LDAP server may have some or all attributes overridden, or new attributes added, by entries in the local database before being presented to the client.

A search operation is first populated with entries from the remote LDAP server, the attributes of which are then overridden with any attributes defined in the local database. Local overrides may be populated with the add, modify, and modrdn operations, the use of which is restricted to the root user of the translucent local database.

A compare operation will perform a comparison with attributes defined in the local database record (if any) before any comparison is made with data in the remote database.
12.15.2. Translucent Proxy Configuration

There are various options available with this overlay, but for this example we will demonstrate adding new attributes to a remote entry and also searching against these newly added local attributes. For more information about overriding remote entries and search configuration, please see slapo-translucent(5)

Note: The Translucent Proxy overlay will disable schema checking in the local database, so that an entry consisting of overlay attributes need not adhere to the complete schema.

First we configure the overlay in the normal manner:

       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
    
       pidfile     ./slapd.pid
       argsfile    ./slapd.args
    
       database    bdb
       suffix      "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
       rootdn      "cn=trans,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
       rootpw      secret
       directory   ./openldap-data
    
       index       objectClass eq
    
       overlay     translucent
       translucent_local carLicense
    
       uri         ldap://192.168.X.X:389
       lastmod     off
       acl-bind    binddn="cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" credentials="blahblah"

You will notice the overlay directive and a directive to say what attribute we want to be able to search against in the local database. We must also load the ldap backend which will connect to the remote directory server.

Now we take an example LDAP group:

       # itsupport, Groups, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: sambaGroupMapping
       cn: itsupport
       gidNumber: 1000
       sambaSID: S-1-5-21-XXX
       sambaGroupType: 2
       displayName: itsupport
       memberUid: ghenry
       memberUid: joebloggs

and create an LDIF file we can use to add our data to the local database, using some pretty strange choices of new attributes for demonstration purposes:

       [ghenry@suretec test_configs]$ cat test-translucent-add.ldif
       dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       businessCategory: frontend-override
       carLicense: LIVID
       employeeType: special
       departmentNumber: 9999999
       roomNumber: 41L-535

Searching against the proxy gives:

       [ghenry@suretec test_configs]$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:9001 "(cn=itsupport)"
       # itsupport, Groups, OxObjects, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: sambaGroupMapping
       cn: itsupport
       gidNumber: 1003
       SAMBASID: S-1-5-21-XXX
       SAMBAGROUPTYPE: 2
       displayName: itsupport
       memberUid: ghenry
       memberUid: joebloggs
       roomNumber: 41L-535
       departmentNumber: 9999999
       employeeType: special
       carLicense: LIVID
       businessCategory: frontend-override

Here we can see that the 5 new attributes are added to the remote entry before being returned to the our client.

Because we have configured a local attribute to search against:

       overlay     translucent
       translucent_local carLicense

we can also search for that to return the completely fabricated entry:

       ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:9001 (carLicense=LIVID)

This is an extremely feature because you can then extend a remote directory server locally and also search against the local entries.

Note: Because the translucent overlay does not perform any DN rewrites, the local and remote database instances must have the same suffix. Other configurations will probably fail with No Such Object and other errors

12.15.3. Further Information

slapo-translucent(5)
12.16. Attribute Uniqueness
12.16.1. Overview

This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-bdb(5) to enforce the uniqueness of some or all attributes within a subtree.
12.16.2. Attribute Uniqueness Configuration

This overlay is only effective on new data from the point the overlay is enabled. To check uniqueness for existing data, you can export and import your data again via the LDAP Add operation, which will not be suitable for large amounts of data, unlike slapcat.

For the following example, if uniqueness were enforced for the mail attribute, the subtree would be searched for any other records which also have a mail attribute containing the same value presented with an add, modify or modrdn operation which are unique within the configured scope. If any are found, the request is rejected.

Note: If no attributes are specified, for example ldap:///??sub?, then the URI applies to all non-operational attributes. However, the keyword ignore can be specified to exclude certain non-operational attributes.

To search at the base dn of the current backend database ensuring uniqueness of the mail attribute, we simply add the following configuration:

       overlay unique
       unique_uri ldap:///?mail?sub?

For an existing entry of:

       dn: cn=gavin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: inetorgperson
       cn: gavin
       sn: henry
       mail: ghenry@suretecsystems.com

and we then try to add a new entry of:

       dn: cn=robert,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: inetorgperson
       cn: robert
       sn: jones
       mail: ghenry@suretecsystems.com

would result in an error like so:

       adding new entry "cn=robert,dc=example,dc=com"
       ldap_add: Constraint violation (19)
               additional info: some attributes not unique

The overlay can have multiple URIs specified within a domain, allowing complex selections of objects and also have multiple unique_uri statements or olcUniqueURI attributes which will create independent domains.

For more information and details about the strict and ignore keywords, please see the slapo-unique(5) man page.
12.16.3. Further Information

slapo-unique(5)
12.17. Value Sorting
12.17.1. Overview

The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a backend database to sort the values of specific multi-valued attributes within a subtree. The sorting occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search response.
12.17.2. Value Sorting Configuration

Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using either numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a "weighted" sort can be specified, which uses a numeric weight prepended to the attribute values.

The weighted sort is always performed in ascending order, but may be combined with the other methods for values that all have equal weights. The weight is specified by prepending an integer weight {<weight>} in front of each value of the attribute for which weighted sorting is desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and never returned in search results.

Here are a few examples:

       loglevel    sync stats
    
       database    hdb
       suffix      "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
       directory   /usr/local/var/openldap-data
    
       ......
    
       overlay valsort
       valsort-attr memberUid ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com alpha-ascend

For example, ascend:

       # sharedemail, Groups, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: top
       cn: sharedemail
       gidNumber: 517
       memberUid: admin
       memberUid: dovecot
       memberUid: laura
       memberUid: suretec

For weighted, we change our data to:

       # sharedemail, Groups, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: top
       cn: sharedemail
       gidNumber: 517
       memberUid: {4}admin
       memberUid: {2}dovecot
       memberUid: {1}laura
       memberUid: {3}suretec

and change the config to:

       overlay valsort
       valsort-attr memberUid ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com weighted

Searching now results in:

       # sharedemail, Groups, OxObjects, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: top
       cn: sharedemail
       gidNumber: 517
       memberUid: laura
       memberUid: dovecot
       memberUid: suretec
       memberUid: admin

12.18. Overlay Stacking
12.18.1. Overview

Overlays can be stacked, which means that more than one overlay can be instantiated for each database, or for the frontend. As a consequence, each overlays function is called, if defined, when overlay execution is invoked. Multiple overlays are executed in reverse order (as a stack) with respect to their definition in slapd.conf (5), or with respect to their ordering in the config database, as documented in slapd-config (5).

13. Schema Specification

This chapter describes how to extend the user schema used by slapd(8). The chapter assumes the reader is familiar with the LDAP/X.500 information model.

The first section, Distributed Schema Files details optional schema definitions provided in the distribution and where to obtain other definitions. The second section, Extending Schema, details how to define new schema items.

This chapter does not discuss how to extend system schema used by slapd(8) as this requires source code modification. System schema includes all operational attribute types or any object class which allows or requires an operational attribute (directly or indirectly).
13.1. Distributed Schema Files

OpenLDAP Software is distributed with a set of schema specifications for your use. Each set is defined in a file suitable for inclusion (using the include directive) in your slapd.conf(5) file. These schema files are normally installed in the /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema directory.
Table 8.1: Provided Schema Specifications File 	Description
core.schema 	OpenLDAP core (required)
cosine.schema 	Cosine and Internet X.500 (useful)
inetorgperson.schema 	InetOrgPerson (useful)
misc.schema 	Assorted (experimental)
nis.schema 	Network Information Services (FYI)
openldap.schema 	OpenLDAP Project (experimental)

To use any of these schema files, you only need to include the desired file in the global definitions portion of your slapd.conf(5) file. For example:

        # include schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema

Additional files may be available. Please consult the OpenLDAP FAQ (http://www.openldap.org/faq/).

Note: You should not modify any of the schema items defined in provided files.

13.2. Extending Schema

Schema used by slapd(8) may be extended to support additional syntaxes, matching rules, attribute types, and object classes. This chapter details how to add user application attribute types and object classes using the syntaxes and matching rules already supported by slapd. slapd can also be extended to support additional syntaxes, matching rules and system schema, but this requires some programming and hence is not discussed here.

There are five steps to defining new schema:

    obtain Object Identifier
    choose a name prefix
    create local schema file
    define custom attribute types (if necessary)
    define custom object classes

13.2.1. Object Identifiers

Each schema element is identified by a globally unique Object Identifier (OID). OIDs are also used to identify other objects. They are commonly found in protocols described by ASN.1. In particular, they are heavily used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). As OIDs are hierarchical, your organization can obtain one OID and branch it as needed. For example, if your organization were assigned OID 1.1, you could branch the tree as follows:
Table 8.2: Example OID hierarchy OID 	Assignment
1.1 	Organization's OID
1.1.1 	SNMP Elements
1.1.2 	LDAP Elements
1.1.2.1 	AttributeTypes
1.1.2.1.1 	x-my-Attribute
1.1.2.2 	ObjectClasses
1.1.2.2.1 	x-my-ObjectClass

You are, of course, free to design a hierarchy suitable to your organizational needs under your organization's OID. No matter what hierarchy you choose, you should maintain a registry of assignments you make. This can be a simple flat file or something more sophisticated such as the OpenLDAP OID Registry (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=197).

For more information about Object Identifiers (and a listing service) see http://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/.

    Under no circumstances should you hijack OID namespace!

To obtain a registered OID at no cost, apply for a OID under the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (ORG:IANA) maintained Private Enterprise arc. Any private enterprise (organization) may request a Private Enterprise Number (PEN) to be assigned under this arc. Just fill out the IANA form at http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page and your official PEN will be sent to you usually within a few days. Your base OID will be something like 1.3.6.1.4.1.X where X is an integer.

Note: PENs obtained using this form may be used for any purpose including identifying LDAP schema elements.

Alternatively, OID name space may be available from a national authority (e.g., ANSI, BSI).
13.2.2. Naming Elements

In addition to assigning a unique object identifier to each schema element, you should provide at least one textual name for each element. Names should be registered with the IANA or prefixed with "x-" to place in the "private use" name space.

The name should be both descriptive and not likely to clash with names of other schema elements. In particular, any name you choose should not clash with present or future Standard Track names (this is assured if you registered names or use names beginning with "x-").

It is noted that you can obtain your own registered name prefix so as to avoid having to register your names individually. See RFC4520 for details.

In the examples below, we have used a short prefix 'x-my-'. Such a short prefix would only be suitable for a very large, global organization. In general, we recommend something like 'x-de-Firm-' (German company) or 'x-com-Example' (elements associated with organization associated with example.com).
13.2.3. Local schema file

The objectclass and attributeTypes configuration file directives can be used to define schema rules on entries in the directory. It is customary to create a file to contain definitions of your custom schema items. We recommend you create a file local.schema in /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema and then include this file in your slapd.conf(5) file immediately after other schema include directives.

        # include schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
        # include local schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema

13.2.4. Attribute Type Specification

The attributetype directive is used to define a new attribute type. The directive uses the same Attribute Type Description (as defined in RFC4512) used by the attributeTypes attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:

        attributetype <RFC4512 Attribute Type Description>

where Attribute Type Description is defined by the following ABNF:

      AttributeTypeDescription = "(" whsp
            numericoid whsp              ; AttributeType identifier
          [ "NAME" qdescrs ]             ; name used in AttributeType
          [ "DESC" qdstring ]            ; description
          [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
          [ "SUP" woid ]                 ; derived from this other
                                         ; AttributeType
          [ "EQUALITY" woid              ; Matching Rule name
          [ "ORDERING" woid              ; Matching Rule name
          [ "SUBSTR" woid ]              ; Matching Rule name
          [ "SYNTAX" whsp noidlen whsp ] ; Syntax OID
          [ "SINGLE-VALUE" whsp ]        ; default multi-valued
          [ "COLLECTIVE" whsp ]          ; default not collective
          [ "NO-USER-MODIFICATION" whsp ]; default user modifiable
          [ "USAGE" whsp AttributeUsage ]; default userApplications
          whsp ")"
    
      AttributeUsage =
          "userApplications"     /
          "directoryOperation"   /
          "distributedOperation" / ; DSA-shared
          "dSAOperation"          ; DSA-specific, value depends on server

where whsp is a space (' '), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. 1.1.0), qdescrs is one or more names, woid is either the name or OID optionally followed by a length specifier (e.g {10}).

For example, the attribute types name and cn are defined in core.schema as:

        attributeType ( 2.5.4.41 NAME 'name'
                DESC 'name(s) associated with the object'
                EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{32768} )
        attributeType ( 2.5.4.3 NAME ( 'cn' 'commonName' )
                DESC 'common name(s) assciated with the object'
                SUP name )

Notice that each defines the attribute's OID, provides a short name, and a brief description. Each name is an alias for the OID. slapd(8) returns the first listed name when returning results.

The first attribute, name, holds values of directoryString (UTF-8 encoded Unicode) syntax. The syntax is specified by OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 identifies the directoryString syntax). A length recommendation of 32768 is specified. Servers should support values of this length, but may support longer values. The field does NOT specify a size constraint, so is ignored on servers (such as slapd) which don't impose such size limits. In addition, the equality and substring matching uses case ignore rules. Below are tables listing commonly used syntax and matching rules (slapd(8) supports these and many more).
Table 8.3: Commonly Used Syntaxes Name 	OID 	Description
boolean 	1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 	boolean value
directoryString 	1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 	Unicode (UTF-8) string

objectIdentiferMatch 	equality 	object identifier

The second attribute, cn, is a subtype of name hence it inherits the syntax, matching rules, and usage of name. commonName is an alternative name.

Neither attribute is restricted to a single value. Both are meant for usage by user applications. Neither is obsolete nor collective.

The following subsections provide a couple of examples.
13.2.4.1. x-my-UniqueName

Many organizations maintain a single unique name for each user. Though one could use displayName (RFC2798), this attribute is really meant to be controlled by the user, not the organization. We could just copy the definition of displayName from inetorgperson.schema and replace the OID, name, and description, e.g:

        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'x-my-UniqueName'
                DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
                SINGLE-VALUE )

However, if we want this name to be used in name assertions, e.g. (name=*Jane*), the attribute could alternatively be defined as a subtype of name, e.g.:

        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'x-my-UniqueName'
                DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                SUP name )

13.2.4.2. x-my-Photo

Many organizations maintain a photo of each each user. A x-my-Photo attribute type could be defined to hold a photo. Of course, one could use just use jpegPhoto (RFC2798) (or a subtype) to hold the photo. However, you can only do this if the photo is in JPEG File Interchange Format. Alternatively, an attribute type which uses the Octet String syntax can be defined, e.g.:

        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.2 NAME 'x-my-Photo'
                DESC 'a photo (application defined format)'
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40
                SINGLE-VALUE )

In this case, the syntax doesn't specify the format of the photo. It's assumed (maybe incorrectly) that all applications accessing this attribute agree on the handling of values.

If you wanted to support multiple photo formats, you could define a separate attribute type for each format, prefix the photo with some typing information, or describe the value using ASN.1 and use the ;binary transfer option.

Another alternative is for the attribute to hold a URI pointing to the photo. You can model such an attribute after labeledURI (RFC2079) or simply create a subtype, e.g.:

        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.3 NAME 'x-my-PhotoURI'
                DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                SUP labeledURI )

13.2.5. Object Class Specification

The objectclasses directive is used to define a new object class. The directive uses the same Object Class Description (as defined in RFC4512) used by the objectClasses attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:

        objectclass <RFC4512 Object Class Description>

where Object Class Description is defined by the following ABNF:

        ObjectClassDescription = "(" whsp
                numericoid whsp      ; ObjectClass identifier
                [ "NAME" qdescrs ]
                [ "DESC" qdstring ]
                [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
                [ "SUP" oids ]       ; Superior ObjectClasses
                [ ( "ABSTRACT" / "STRUCTURAL" / "AUXILIARY" ) whsp ]
                        ; default structural
                [ "MUST" oids ]      ; AttributeTypes
                [ "MAY" oids ]       ; AttributeTypes
                whsp ")"

where whsp is a space (' '), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. 1.1.0), qdescrs is one or more names, and oids is one or more names and/or OIDs.
13.2.5.1. x-my-PhotoObject

To define an auxiliary object class which allows x-my-Photo to be added to any existing entry.

        objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.1 NAME 'x-my-PhotoObject'
                DESC 'mixin x-my-Photo'
                AUXILIARY
                MAY x-my-Photo )

13.2.5.2. x-my-Person

If your organization would like have a private structural object class to instantiate users, you can subclass one of the existing person classes, such as inetOrgPerson (RFC2798), and add any additional attributes which you desire.

        objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.2 NAME 'x-my-Person'
                DESC 'my person'
                SUP inetOrgPerson
                MUST ( x-my-UniqueName $ givenName )
                MAY x-my-Photo )

The object class inherits the required/allowed attribute types of inetOrgPerson but requires x-my-UniqueName and givenName and allows x-my-Photo.
13.2.6. OID Macros

To ease the management and use of OIDs, slapd(8) supports Object Identifier macros. The objectIdentifier directive is used to equate a macro (name) with a OID. The OID may possibly be derived from a previously defined OID macro. The slapd.conf(5) syntax is:

        objectIdentifier <name> { <oid> | <name>[:<suffix>] }

The following demonstrates definition of a set of OID macros and their use in defining schema elements:

        objectIdentifier myOID  1.1
        objectIdentifier mySNMP myOID:1
        objectIdentifier myLDAP myOID:2
        objectIdentifier myAttributeType        myLDAP:1
        objectIdentifier myObjectClass  myLDAP:2
        attributetype ( myAttributeType:3 NAME 'x-my-PhotoURI'
                DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                SUP labeledURI )
        objectclass ( myObjectClass:1 NAME 'x-my-PhotoObject'
                DESC 'mixin x-my-Photo'
                AUXILIARY
                MAY x-my-Photo )

14. Security Considerations

OpenLDAP Software is designed to run in a wide variety of computing environments from tightly-controlled closed networks to the global Internet. Hence, OpenLDAP Software supports many different security mechanisms. This chapter describes these mechanisms and discusses security considerations for using OpenLDAP Software.
14.1. Network Security
14.1.1. Selective Listening

By default, slapd(8) will listen on both the IPv4 and IPv6 "any" addresses. It is often desirable to have slapd listen on select address/port pairs. For example, listening only on the IPv4 address 127.0.0.1 will disallow remote access to the directory server. E.g.:

        slapd -h ldap://127.0.0.1

While the server can be configured to listen on a particular interface address, this doesn't necessarily restrict access to the server to only those networks accessible via that interface. To selective restrict remote access, it is recommend that an IP Firewall be used to restrict access.

See Command-line Options and slapd(8) for more information.
14.1.2. IP Firewall

IP firewall capabilities of the server system can be used to restrict access based upon the client's IP address and/or network interface used to communicate with the client.

Generally, slapd(8) listens on port 389/tcp for ldap:// sessions and port 636/tcp for ldaps://) sessions. slapd(8) may be configured to listen on other ports.

As specifics of how to configure IP firewall are dependent on the particular kind of IP firewall used, no examples are provided here. See the document associated with your IP firewall.
14.1.3. TCP Wrappers

slapd(8) supports TCP Wrappers. TCP Wrappers provide a rule-based access control system for controlling TCP/IP access to the server. For example, the host_options(5) rule:

        slapd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 : ALLOW
        slapd: ALL : DENY

allows only incoming connections from the private network 10.0.0.0 and localhost (127.0.0.1) to access the directory service.

Note: IP addresses are used as slapd(8) is not normally configured to perform reverse lookups.

It is noted that TCP wrappers require the connection to be accepted. As significant processing is required just to deny a connection, it is generally advised that IP firewall protection be used instead of TCP wrappers.

See hosts_access(5) for more information on TCP wrapper rules.
14.2. Data Integrity and Confidentiality Protection

Transport Layer Security (TLS) can be used to provide data integrity and confidentiality protection. OpenLDAP supports negotiation of TLS (SSL) via both StartTLS and ldaps://. See the Using TLS chapter for more information. StartTLS is the standard track mechanism.

A number of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms, such as DIGEST-MD5 and GSSAPI, also provide data integrity and confidentiality protection. See the Using SASL chapter for more information.
14.2.1. Security Strength Factors

The server uses Security Strength Factors (SSF) to indicate the relative strength of protection. A SSF of zero (0) indicates no protections are in place. A SSF of one (1) indicates integrity protection are in place. A SSF greater than one (>1) roughly correlates to the effective encryption key length. For example, DES is 56, 3DES is 112, and AES 128, 192, or 256.

A number of administrative controls rely on SSFs associated with TLS and SASL protection in place on an LDAP session.

security controls disallow operations when appropriate protections are not in place. For example:

        security ssf=1 update_ssf=112

requires integrity protection for all operations and encryption protection, 3DES equivalent, for update operations (e.g. add, delete, modify, etc.). See slapd.conf(5) for details.

For fine-grained control, SSFs may be used in access controls. See the Access Control section for more information.
14.3. Authentication Methods
14.3.1. "simple" method

The LDAP "simple" method has three modes of operation:

    anonymous,
    unauthenticated, and
    user/password authenticated.

Anonymous access is requested by providing no name and no password to the "simple" bind operation. Unauthenticated access is requested by providing a name but no password. Authenticated access is requested by providing a valid name and password.

An anonymous bind results in an anonymous authorization association. Anonymous bind mechanism is enabled by default, but can be disabled by specifying "disallow bind_anon" in slapd.conf(5).

Note: Disabling the anonymous bind mechanism does not prevent anonymous access to the directory. To require authentication to access the directory, one should instead specify "require authc".

An unauthenticated bind also results in an anonymous authorization association. Unauthenticated bind mechanism is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying "allow bind_anon_cred" in slapd.conf(5). As a number of LDAP applications mistakenly generate unauthenticated bind request when authenticated access was intended (that is, they do not ensure a password was provided), this mechanism should generally remain disabled.

A successful user/password authenticated bind results in a user authorization identity, the provided name, being associated with the session. User/password authenticated bind is enabled by default. However, as this mechanism itself offers no eavesdropping protection (e.g., the password is set in the clear), it is recommended that it be used only in tightly controlled systems or when the LDAP session is protected by other means (e.g., TLS, IPsec). Where the administrator relies on TLS to protect the password, it is recommended that unprotected authentication be disabled. This is done using the security directive's simple_bind option, which provides fine grain control over the level of confidential protection to require for simple user/password authentication. E.g., using security simple_bind=56 would require simple binds to use encryption of DES equivalent or better.

The user/password authenticated bind mechanism can be completely disabled by setting "disallow bind_simple".

Note: An unsuccessful bind always results in the session having an anonymous authorization association.

14.3.2. SASL method

The LDAP SASL method allows the use of any SASL authentication mechanism. The Using SASL section discusses the use of SASL.
14.4. Password Storage

LDAP passwords are normally stored in the userPassword attribute. RFC4519 specifies that passwords are not stored in encrypted (or hashed) form. This allows a wide range of password-based authentication mechanisms, such as DIGEST-MD5 to be used. This is also the most interoperable storage scheme.

However, it may be desirable to store a hash of password instead. slapd(8) supports a variety of storage schemes for the administrator to choose from.

Note: Values of password attributes, regardless of storage scheme used, should be protected as if they were clear text. Hashed passwords are subject to dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks.

The userPassword attribute is allowed to have more than one value, and it is possible for each value to be stored in a different form. During authentication, slapd will iterate through the values until it finds one that matches the offered password or until it runs out of values to inspect. The storage scheme is stored as a prefix on the value, so a hashed password using the Salted SHA1 (SSHA) scheme looks like:

 userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3

The advantage of hashed passwords is that an attacker which discovers the hash does not have direct access to the actual password. Unfortunately, as dictionary and brute force attacks are generally quite easy for attackers to successfully mount, this advantage is marginal at best (this is why all modern Unix systems use shadow password files).

The disadvantages of hashed storage is that they are non-standard, may cause interoperability problem, and generally preclude the use of stronger than Simple (or SASL/PLAIN) password-based authentication mechanisms such as DIGEST-MD5.
14.4.1. SSHA password storage scheme

This is the salted version of the SHA scheme. It is believed to be the most secure password storage scheme supported by slapd.

These values represent the same password:

 userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3
 userPassword: {SSHA}d0Q0626PSH9VUld7yWpR0k6BlpQmtczb

14.4.2. CRYPT password storage scheme

This scheme uses the operating system's crypt(3) hash function. It normally produces the traditional Unix-style 13 character hash, but on systems with glibc2 it can also generate the more secure 34-byte MD5 hash.

 userPassword: {CRYPT}aUihad99hmev6
 userPassword: {CRYPT}$1$czBJdDqS$TmkzUAb836oMxg/BmIwN.1

The advantage of the CRYPT scheme is that passwords can be transferred to or from an existing Unix password file without having to know the cleartext form. Both forms of crypt include salt so they have some resistance to dictionary attacks.

Note: Since this scheme uses the operating system's crypt(3) hash function, it is therefore operating system specific.

14.4.3. MD5 password storage scheme

This scheme simply takes the MD5 hash of the password and stores it in base64 encoded form:

 userPassword: {MD5}Xr4ilOzQ4PCOq3aQ0qbuaQ==

Although safer than cleartext storage, this is not a very secure scheme. The MD5 algorithm is fast, and because there is no salt the scheme is vulnerable to a dictionary attack.
14.4.4. SMD5 password storage scheme

This improves on the basic MD5 scheme by adding salt (random data which means that there are many possible representations of a given plaintext password). For example, both of these values represent the same password:

 userPassword: {SMD5}4QWGWZpj9GCmfuqEvm8HtZhZS6E=
 userPassword: {SMD5}g2/J/7D5EO6+oPdklp5p8YtNFk4=

14.4.5. SHA password storage scheme

Like the MD5 scheme, this simply feeds the password through an SHA hash process. SHA is thought to be more secure than MD5, but the lack of salt leaves the scheme exposed to dictionary attacks.

 userPassword: {SHA}5en6G6MezRroT3XKqkdPOmY/BfQ=

14.4.6. SASL password storage scheme

This is not really a password storage scheme at all. It uses the value of the userPassword attribute to delegate password verification to another process. See below for more information.

Note: This is not the same as using SASL to authenticate the LDAP session.

14.5. Pass-Through authentication

Since OpenLDAP 2.0 slapd has had the ability to delegate password verification to a separate process. This uses the sasl_checkpass(3) function so it can use any back-end server that Cyrus SASL supports for checking passwords. The choice is very wide, as one option is to use saslauthd(8) which in turn can use local files, Kerberos, an IMAP server, another LDAP server, or anything supported by the PAM mechanism.

The server must be built with the --enable-spasswd configuration option to enable pass-through authentication.

Note: This is not the same as using a SASL mechanism to authenticate the LDAP session.

Pass-Through authentication works only with plaintext passwords, as used in the "simple bind" and "SASL PLAIN" authentication mechanisms.}}

Pass-Through authentication is selective: it only affects users whose userPassword attribute has a value marked with the "{SASL}" scheme. The format of the attribute is:

 userPassword: {SASL}username@realm

The username and realm are passed to the SASL authentication mechanism and are used to identify the account whose password is to be verified. This allows arbitrary mapping between entries in OpenLDAP and accounts known to the backend authentication service.

It would be wise to use access control to prevent users from changing their passwords through LDAP where they have pass-through authentication enabled.
14.5.1. Configuring slapd to use an authentication provider

Where an entry has a "{SASL}" password value, OpenLDAP delegates the whole process of validating that entry's password to Cyrus SASL. All the configuration is therefore done in SASL config files.

The first file to be considered is confusingly named slapd.conf and is typically found in the SASL library directory, often /usr/lib/sasl2/slapd.conf This file governs the use of SASL when talking LDAP to slapd as well as the use of SASL backends for pass-through authentication. See options.html in the Cyrus SASL docs for full details. Here is a simple example for a server that will use saslauthd to verify passwords:

 mech_list: plain
 pwcheck_method: saslauthd
 saslauthd_path: /var/run/sasl2/mux

14.5.2. Configuring saslauthd

saslauthd is capable of using many different authentication services: see saslauthd(8) for details. A common requirement is to delegate some or all authentication to another LDAP server. Here is a sample saslauthd.conf that uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD):

 ldap_servers: ldap://dc1.example.com/ ldap://dc2.example.com/

 ldap_search_base: cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
 ldap_filter: (userPrincipalName=%u)

 ldap_bind_dn: cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
 ldap_password: secret

In this case, saslauthd is run with the ldap authentication mechanism and is set to combine the SASL realm with the login name:

 saslauthd -a ldap -r

This means that the "username@realm" string from the userPassword attribute ends up being used to search AD for "userPrincipalName=username@realm" - the password is then verified by attempting to bind to AD using the entry found by the search and the password supplied by the LDAP client.
14.5.3. Testing pass-through authentication

It is usually best to start with the back-end authentication provider and work through saslauthd and slapd towards the LDAP client.

In the AD example above, first check that the DN and password that saslauthd will use when it connects to AD are valid:

 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w secret \
      -b '' \
      -s base

Next check that a sample AD user can be found:

 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w secret \
      -b cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      "(userPrincipalName=user@ad.example.com)"

Check that the user can bind to AD:

 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w userpassword \
      -b cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -s base \
        "(objectclass=*)"

If all that works then saslauthd should be able to do the same:

 testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p userpassword
 testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p wrongpassword

Now put the magic token into an entry in OpenLDAP:

 userPassword: {SASL}user@ad.example.com

It should now be possible to bind to OpenLDAP using the DN of that entry and the password of the AD user.

15. Using SASL

OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of authenticating via the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework, which is detailed in RFC4422. This chapter describes how to make use of SASL in OpenLDAP.

There are several industry standard authentication mechanisms that can be used with SASL, including GSSAPI for Kerberos V, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN and EXTERNAL for use with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The standard client tools provided with OpenLDAP Software, such as ldapsearch(1) and ldapmodify(1), will by default attempt to authenticate the user to the LDAP directory server using SASL. Basic authentication service can be set up by the LDAP administrator with a few steps, allowing users to be authenticated to the slapd server as their LDAP entry. With a few extra steps, some users and services can be allowed to exploit SASL's proxy authorization feature, allowing them to authenticate themselves and then switch their identity to that of another user or service.

This chapter assumes you have read Cyrus SASL for System Administrators, provided with the Cyrus SASL package (in doc/sysadmin.html) and have a working Cyrus SASL installation. You should use the Cyrus SASL sample_client and sample_server to test your SASL installation before attempting to make use of it with OpenLDAP Software.

Note that in the following text the term user is used to describe a person or application entity who is connecting to the LDAP server via an LDAP client, such as ldapsearch(1). That is, the term user not only applies to both an individual using an LDAP client, but to an application entity which issues LDAP client operations without direct user control. For example, an e-mail server which uses LDAP operations to access information held in an LDAP server is an application entity.
15.1. SASL Security Considerations

SASL offers many different authentication mechanisms. This section briefly outlines security considerations.

Some mechanisms, such as PLAIN and LOGIN, offer no greater security over LDAP simple authentication. Like LDAP simple authentication, such mechanisms should not be used unless you have adequate security protections in place. It is recommended that these mechanisms be used only in conjunction with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Use of PLAIN and LOGIN are not discussed further in this document.

The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism is the mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism for LDAPv3. Though DIGEST-MD5 is not a strong authentication mechanism in comparison with trusted third party authentication systems (such as Kerberos or public key systems), it does offer significant protections against a number of attacks. Unlike the CRAM-MD5 mechanism, it prevents chosen plaintext attacks. DIGEST-MD5 is favored over the use of plaintext password mechanisms. The CRAM-MD5 mechanism is deprecated in favor of DIGEST-MD5. Use of DIGEST-MD5 is discussed below.

The GSSAPI mechanism utilizes GSS-API Kerberos V to provide secure authentication services. The KERBEROS_V4 mechanism is available for those using Kerberos IV. Kerberos is viewed as a secure, distributed authentication system suitable for both small and large enterprises. Use of GSSAPI and KERBEROS_V4 are discussed below.

The EXTERNAL mechanism utilizes authentication services provided by lower level network services such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When used in conjunction with TLS X.509-based public key technology, EXTERNAL offers strong authentication. TLS is discussed in the Using TLS chapter.

EXTERNAL can also be used with the ldapi:/// transport, as Unix-domain sockets can report the UID and GID of the client process.

There are other strong authentication mechanisms to choose from, including OTP (one time passwords) and SRP (secure remote passwords). These mechanisms are not discussed in this document.
15.2. SASL Authentication

Getting basic SASL authentication running involves a few steps. The first step configures your slapd server environment so that it can communicate with client programs using the security system in place at your site. This usually involves setting up a service key, a public key, or other form of secret. The second step concerns mapping authentication identities to LDAP DN's, which depends on how entries are laid out in your directory. An explanation of the first step will be given in the next section using Kerberos V4 as an example mechanism. The steps necessary for your site's authentication mechanism will be similar, but a guide to every mechanism available under SASL is beyond the scope of this chapter. The second step is described in the section Mapping Authentication Identities.
15.2.1. GSSAPI

This section describes the use of the SASL GSSAPI mechanism and Kerberos V with OpenLDAP. It will be assumed that you have Kerberos V deployed, you are familiar with the operation of the system, and that your users are trained in its use. This section also assumes you have familiarized yourself with the use of the GSSAPI mechanism by reading Configuring GSSAPI and Cyrus SASL (provided with Cyrus SASL in the doc/gssapi file) and successfully experimented with the Cyrus provided sample_server and sample_client applications. General information about Kerberos is available at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/.

To use the GSSAPI mechanism with slapd(8) one must create a service key with a principal for ldap service within the realm for the host on which the service runs. For example, if you run slapd on directory.example.com and your realm is EXAMPLE.COM, you need to create a service key with the principal:

        ldap/directory.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

When slapd(8) runs, it must have access to this key. This is generally done by placing the key into a keytab file, /etc/krb5.keytab. See your Kerberos and Cyrus SASL documentation for information regarding keytab location settings.

To use the GSSAPI mechanism to authenticate to the directory, the user obtains a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) prior to running the LDAP client. When using OpenLDAP client tools, the user may mandate use of the GSSAPI mechanism by specifying -Y GSSAPI as a command option.

For the purposes of authentication and authorization, slapd(8) associates an authentication request DN of the form:

        uid=<primary[/instance]>,cn=<realm>,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

Continuing our example, a user with the Kerberos principal kurt@EXAMPLE.COM would have the associated DN:

        uid=kurt,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

and the principal ursula/admin@FOREIGN.REALM would have the associated DN:

        uid=ursula/admin,cn=foreign.realm,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

The authentication request DN can be used directly ACLs and groupOfNames "member" attributes, since it is of legitimate LDAP DN format. Or alternatively, the authentication DN could be mapped before use. See the section Mapping Authentication Identities for details.
15.2.2. KERBEROS_V4

This section describes the use of the SASL KERBEROS_V4 mechanism with OpenLDAP. It will be assumed that you are familiar with the workings of the Kerberos IV security system, and that your site has Kerberos IV deployed. Your users should be familiar with authentication policy, how to receive credentials in a Kerberos ticket cache, and how to refresh expired credentials.

Note: KERBEROS_V4 and Kerberos IV are deprecated in favor of GSSAPI and Kerberos V.

Client programs will need to be able to obtain a session key for use when connecting to your LDAP server. This allows the LDAP server to know the identity of the user, and allows the client to know it is connecting to a legitimate server. If encryption layers are to be used, the session key can also be used to help negotiate that option.

The slapd server runs the service called "ldap", and the server will require a srvtab file with a service key. SASL aware client programs will be obtaining an "ldap" service ticket with the user's ticket granting ticket (TGT), with the instance of the ticket matching the hostname of the OpenLDAP server. For example, if your realm is named EXAMPLE.COM and the slapd server is running on the host named directory.example.com, the /etc/srvtab file on the server will have a service key

        ldap.directory@EXAMPLE.COM

When an LDAP client is authenticating a user to the directory using the KERBEROS_IV mechanism, it will request a session key for that same principal, either from the ticket cache or by obtaining a new one from the Kerberos server. This will require the TGT to be available and valid in the cache as well. If it is not present or has expired, the client may print out the message:

        ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error

When the service ticket is obtained, it will be passed to the LDAP server as proof of the user's identity. The server will extract the identity and realm out of the service ticket using SASL library calls, and convert them into an authentication request DN of the form

        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

So in our above example, if the user's name were "adamson", the authentication request DN would be:

        uid=adamsom,cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth

This authentication request DN can be used directly ACLs or, alternatively, mapped prior to use. See the section Mapping Authentication Identities for details.
15.2.3. DIGEST-MD5

This section describes the use of the SASL DIGEST-MD5 mechanism using secrets stored either in the directory itself or in Cyrus SASL's own database. DIGEST-MD5 relies on the client and the server sharing a "secret", usually a password. The server generates a challenge and the client a response proving that it knows the shared secret. This is much more secure than simply sending the secret over the wire.

Cyrus SASL supports several shared-secret mechanisms. To do this, it needs access to the plaintext password (unlike mechanisms which pass plaintext passwords over the wire, where the server can store a hashed version of the password).

The server's copy of the shared-secret may be stored in Cyrus SASL's own sasldb database, in an external system accessed via saslauthd, or in LDAP database itself. In either case it is very important to apply file access controls and LDAP access controls to prevent exposure of the passwords. The configuration and commands discussed in this section assume the use of Cyrus SASL 2.1.

To use secrets stored in sasldb, simply add users with the saslpasswd2 command:

       saslpasswd2 -c <username>

The passwords for such users must be managed with the saslpasswd2 command.

To use secrets stored in the LDAP directory, place plaintext passwords in the userPassword attribute. It will be necessary to add an option to slapd.conf to make sure that passwords set using the LDAP Password Modify Operation are stored in plaintext:

       password-hash   {CLEARTEXT}

Passwords stored in this way can be managed either with ldappasswd(1) or by simply modifying the userPassword attribute. Regardless of where the passwords are stored, a mapping will be needed from authentication request DN to user's DN.

The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism produces authentication IDs of the form:

        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth

If the default realm is used, the realm name is omitted from the ID, giving:

        uid=<username>,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth

See Mapping Authentication Identities below for information on optional mapping of identities.

With suitable mappings in place, users can specify SASL IDs when performing LDAP operations, and the password stored in sasldb or in the directory itself will be used to verify the authentication. For example, the user identified by the directory entry:

       dn: cn=Andrew Findlay+uid=u000997,dc=example,dc=com
       objectclass: inetOrgPerson
       objectclass: person
       sn: Findlay
       uid: u000997
       userPassword: secret

can issue commands of the form:

       ldapsearch -Y DIGEST-MD5 -U u000997 ...

Note: in each of the above cases, no authorization identity (e.g. -X) was provided. Unless you are attempting SASL Proxy Authorization, no authorization identity should be specified. The server will infer an authorization identity from authentication identity (as described below).

15.2.4. EXTERNAL

The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism makes use of an authentication performed by a lower-level protocol: usually TLS or Unix IPC

Each transport protocol returns Authentication Identities in its own format:
15.2.4.1. TLS Authentication Identity Format

This is the Subject DN from the client-side certificate. Note that DNs are displayed differently by LDAP and by X.509, so a certificate issued to

        C=gb, O=The Example Organisation, CN=A Person

will produce an authentication identity of:

        cn=A Person,o=The Example Organisation,c=gb

Note that you must set a suitable value for TLSVerifyClient to make the server request the use of a client-side certificate. Without this, the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will not be offered. Refer to the Using TLS chapter for details.
15.2.4.2. IPC (ldapi:///) Identity Format

This is formed from the Unix UID and GID of the client process:

        gidNumber=<number>+uidNumber=<number>,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth

Thus, a client process running as root will be:

        gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth

15.2.5. Mapping Authentication Identities

The authentication mechanism in the slapd server will use SASL library calls to obtain the authenticated user's "username", based on whatever underlying authentication mechanism was used. This username is in the namespace of the authentication mechanism, and not in the normal LDAP namespace. As stated in the sections above, that username is reformatted into an authentication request DN of the form

        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

or

        uid=<username>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

depending on whether or not <mechanism> employs the concept of "realms". Note also that the realm part will be omitted if the default realm was used in the authentication.

The ldapwhoami(1) command may be used to determine the identity associated with the user. It is very useful for determining proper function of mappings.

It is not intended that you should add LDAP entries of the above form to your LDAP database. Chances are you have an LDAP entry for each of the persons that will be authenticating to LDAP, laid out in your directory tree, and the tree does not start at cn=auth. But if your site has a clear mapping between the "username" and an LDAP entry for the person, you will be able to configure your LDAP server to automatically map a authentication request DN to the user's authentication DN.

Note: it is not required that the authentication request DN nor the user's authentication DN resulting from the mapping refer to an entry held in the directory. However, additional capabilities become available (see below).

The LDAP administrator will need to tell the slapd server how to map an authentication request DN to a user's authentication DN. This is done by adding one or more authz-regexp directives to the slapd.conf(5) file. This directive takes two arguments:

        authz-regexp   <search pattern>   <replacement pattern>

The authentication request DN is compared to the search pattern using the regular expression functions regcomp() and regexec(), and if it matches, it is rewritten as the replacement pattern. If there are multiple authz-regexp directives, only the first whose search pattern matches the authentication identity is used. The string that is output from the replacement pattern should be the authentication DN of the user or an LDAP URL. If replacement string produces a DN, the entry named by this DN need not be held by this server. If the replace string produces an LDAP URL, that LDAP URL must evaluate to one and only one entry held by this server.

The search pattern can contain any of the regular expression characters listed in regexec(3C). The main characters of note are dot ".", asterisk "*", and the open and close parenthesis "(" and ")". Essentially, the dot matches any character, the asterisk allows zero or more repeats of the immediately preceding character or pattern, and terms in parenthesis are remembered for the replacement pattern.

The replacement pattern will produce either a DN or URL referring to the user. Anything from the authentication request DN that matched a string in parenthesis in the search pattern is stored in the variable "$1". That variable "$1" can appear in the replacement pattern, and will be replaced by the string from the authentication request DN. If there were multiple sets of parentheses in the search pattern, the variables $2, $3, etc are used.
15.2.6. Direct Mapping

Where possible, direct mapping of the authentication request DN to the user's DN is generally recommended. Aside from avoiding the expense of searching for the user's DN, it allows mapping to DNs which refer to entries not held by this server.

Suppose the authentication request DN is written as:

        uid=adamson,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth

and the user's actual LDAP entry is:

        uid=adamson,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

then the following authz-regexp directive in slapd.conf(5) would provide for direct mapping.

        authz-regexp
          uid=([^,]*),cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
          uid=$1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

An even more lenient rule could be written as

        authz-regexp
          uid=([^,]*),cn=[^,]*,cn=auth
          uid=$1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com

Be careful about setting the search pattern too leniently, however, since it may mistakenly allow persons to become authenticated as a DN to which they should not have access. It is better to write several strict directives than one lenient directive which has security holes. If there is only one authentication mechanism in place at your site, and zero or one realms in use, you might be able to map between authentication identities and LDAP DN's with a single authz-regexp directive.

Don't forget to allow for the case where the realm is omitted as well as the case with an explicitly specified realm. This may well require a separate authz-regexp directive for each case, with the explicit-realm entry being listed first.
15.2.7. Search-based mappings

There are a number of cases where mapping to a LDAP URL may be appropriate. For instance, some sites may have person objects located in multiple areas of the LDAP tree, such as if there were an ou=accounting tree and an ou=engineering tree, with persons interspersed between them. Or, maybe the desired mapping must be based upon information in the user's information. Consider the need to map the above authentication request DN to user whose entry is as follows:

        dn: cn=Mark Adamson,ou=People,dc=Example,dc=COM
        objectclass: person
        cn: Mark Adamson
        uid: adamson

The information in the authentication request DN is insufficient to allow the user's DN to be directly derived, instead the user's DN must be searched for. For these situations, a replacement pattern which produces a LDAP URL can be used in the authz-regexp directives. This URL will then be used to perform an internal search of the LDAP database to find the person's authentication DN.

An LDAP URL, similar to other URL's, is of the form

        ldap://<host>/<base>?<attrs>?<scope>?<filter>

This contains all of the elements necessary to perform an LDAP search: the name of the server <host>, the LDAP DN search base <base>, the LDAP attributes to retrieve <attrs>, the search scope <scope> which is one of the three options "base", "one", or "sub", and lastly an LDAP search filter <filter>. Since the search is for an LDAP DN within the current server, the <host> portion should be empty. The <attrs> field is also ignored since only the DN is of concern. These two elements are left in the format of the URL to maintain the clarity of what information goes where in the string.

Suppose that the person in the example from above did in fact have an authentication username of "adamson" and that information was kept in the attribute "uid" in their LDAP entry. The authz-regexp directive might be written as

        authz-regexp
          uid=([^,]*),cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
          ldap:///ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?(uid=$1)

This will initiate an internal search of the LDAP database inside the slapd server. If the search returns exactly one entry, it is accepted as being the DN of the user. If there are more than one entries returned, or if there are zero entries returned, the authentication fails and the user's connection is left bound as the authentication request DN.

The attributes that are used in the search filter <filter> in the URL should be indexed to allow faster searching. If they are not, the authentication step alone can take uncomfortably long periods, and users may assume the server is down.

A more complex site might have several realms in use, each mapping to a different subtree in the directory. These can be handled with statements of the form:

        # Match Engineering realm
        authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=engineering.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=eng,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))
    
        # Match Accounting realm
        authz-regexp
           uid=([^,].*),cn=accounting.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=accounting,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))
    
        # Default realm is customers.example.com
        authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=customers,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))

Note that the explicitly-named realms are handled first, to avoid the realm name becoming part of the UID. Also note the use of scope and filters to limit matching to desirable entries.

Note as well that authz-regexp internal search are subject to access controls. Specifically, the authentication identity must have auth access.

See slapd.conf(5) for more detailed information.
15.3. SASL Proxy Authorization

The SASL offers a feature known as proxy authorization, which allows an authenticated user to request that they act on the behalf of another user. This step occurs after the user has obtained an authentication DN, and involves sending an authorization identity to the server. The server will then make a decision on whether or not to allow the authorization to occur. If it is allowed, the user's LDAP connection is switched to have a binding DN derived from the authorization identity, and the LDAP session proceeds with the access of the new authorization DN.

The decision to allow an authorization to proceed depends on the rules and policies of the site where LDAP is running, and thus cannot be made by SASL alone. The SASL library leaves it up to the server to make the decision. The LDAP administrator sets the guidelines of who can authorize to what identity by adding information into the LDAP database entries. By default, the authorization features are disabled, and must be explicitly configured by the LDAP administrator before use.
15.3.1. Uses of Proxy Authorization

This sort of service is useful when one entity needs to act on the behalf of many other users. For example, users may be directed to a web page to make changes to their personal information in their LDAP entry. The users authenticate to the web server to establish their identity, but the web server CGI cannot authenticate to the LDAP server as that user to make changes for them. Instead, the web server authenticates itself to the LDAP server as a service identity, say,

        cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com

and then it will SASL authorize to the DN of the user. Once so authorized, the CGI makes changes to the LDAP entry of the user, and as far as the slapd server can tell for its ACLs, it is the user themself on the other end of the connection. The user could have connected to the LDAP server directly and authenticated as themself, but that would require the user to have more knowledge of LDAP clients, knowledge which the web page provides in an easier format.

Proxy authorization can also be used to limit access to an account that has greater access to the database. Such an account, perhaps even the root DN specified in slapd.conf(5), can have a strict list of people who can authorize to that DN. Changes to the LDAP database could then be only allowed by that DN, and in order to become that DN, users must first authenticate as one of the persons on the list. This allows for better auditing of who made changes to the LDAP database. If people were allowed to authenticate directly to the privileged account, possibly through the rootpw slapd.conf(5) directive or through a userPassword attribute, then auditing becomes more difficult.

Note that after a successful proxy authorization, the original authentication DN of the LDAP connection is overwritten by the new DN from the authorization request. If a service program is able to authenticate itself as its own authentication DN and then authorize to other DN's, and it is planning on switching to several different identities during one LDAP session, it will need to authenticate itself each time before authorizing to another DN (or use a different proxy authorization mechanism). The slapd server does not keep record of the service program's ability to switch to other DN's. On authentication mechanisms like Kerberos this will not require multiple connections being made to the Kerberos server, since the user's TGT and "ldap" session key are valid for multiple uses for the several hours of the ticket lifetime.
15.3.2. SASL Authorization Identities

The SASL authorization identity is sent to the LDAP server via the -X switch for ldapsearch(1) and other tools, or in the *authzid parameter to the lutil_sasl_defaults() call. The identity can be in one of two forms, either

        u:<username>

or

        dn:<dn>

In the first form, the <username> is from the same namespace as the authentication identities above. It is the user's username as it is referred to by the underlying authentication mechanism. Authorization identities of this form are converted into a DN format by the same function that the authentication process used, producing an authorization request DN of the form

        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth

That authorization request DN is then run through the same authz-regexp process to convert it into a legitimate authorization DN from the database. If it cannot be converted due to a failed search from an LDAP URL, the authorization request fails with "inappropriate access". Otherwise, the DN string is now a legitimate authorization DN ready to undergo approval.

If the authorization identity was provided in the second form, with a "dn:" prefix, the string after the prefix is already in authorization DN form, ready to undergo approval.
15.3.3. Proxy Authorization Rules

Once slapd has the authorization DN, the actual approval process begins. There are two attributes that the LDAP administrator can put into LDAP entries to allow authorization:

        authzTo
        authzFrom

Both can be multivalued. The authzTo attribute is a source rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the authentication DN to tell what authorization DNs the authenticated DN is allowed to assume. The second attribute is a destination rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the requested authorization DN to tell which authenticated DNs may assume it.

The choice of which authorization policy attribute to use is up to the administrator. Source rules are checked first in the person's authentication DN entry, and if none of the authzTo rules specify the authorization is permitted, the authzFrom rules in the authorization DN entry are then checked. If neither case specifies that the request be honored, the request is denied. Since the default behavior is to deny authorization requests, rules only specify that a request be allowed; there are no negative rules telling what authorizations to deny.

The value(s) in the two attributes are of the same form as the output of the replacement pattern of a authz-regexp directive: either a DN or an LDAP URL. For example, if a authzTo value is a DN, that DN is one the authenticated user can authorize to. On the other hand, if the authzTo value is an LDAP URL, the URL is used as an internal search of the LDAP database, and the authenticated user can become ANY DN returned by the search. If an LDAP entry looked like:

        dn: cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com
        authzTo: ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectclass=person)

then any user who authenticated as cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com could authorize to any other LDAP entry under the search base dc=example,dc=com which has an objectClass of Person.
15.3.3.1. Notes on Proxy Authorization Rules

An LDAP URL in a authzTo or authzFrom attribute will return a set of DNs. Each DN returned will be checked. Searches which return a large set can cause the authorization process to take an uncomfortably long time. Also, searches should be performed on attributes that have been indexed by slapd.

To help produce more sweeping rules for authzFrom and authzTo, the values of these attributes are allowed to be DNs with regular expression characters in them. This means a source rule like

        authzTo: dn.regex:^uid=[^,]*,dc=example,dc=com$

would allow that authenticated user to authorize to any DN that matches the regular expression pattern given. This regular expression comparison can be evaluated much faster than an LDAP search for (uid=*).

Also note that the values in an authorization rule must be one of the two forms: an LDAP URL or a DN (with or without regular expression characters). Anything that does not begin with "ldap://" is taken as a DN. It is not permissible to enter another authorization identity of the form "u:<username>" as an authorization rule.
15.3.3.2. Policy Configuration

The decision of which type of rules to use, authzFrom or authzTo, will depend on the site's situation. For example, if the set of people who may become a given identity can easily be written as a search filter, then a single destination rule could be written. If the set of people is not easily defined by a search filter, and the set of people is small, it may be better to write a source rule in the entries of each of those people who should be allowed to perform the proxy authorization.

By default, processing of proxy authorization rules is disabled. The authz-policy directive must be set in the slapd.conf(5) file to enable authorization. This directive can be set to none for no rules (the default), to for source rules, from for destination rules, or both for both source and destination rules.

Source rules are extremely powerful. If ordinary users have access to write the authzTo attribute in their own entries, then they can write rules that would allow them to authorize as anyone else. As such, when using source rules, the authzTo attribute should be protected with an ACL that only allows privileged users to set its values.

16. Using TLS

OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) framework to provide integrity and confidentiality protections and to support LDAP authentication using the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism. TLS is defined in RFC4346.

Note: For generating certifcates, please reference http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/185.html

16.1. TLS Certificates

TLS uses X.509 certificates to carry client and server identities. All servers are required to have valid certificates, whereas client certificates are optional. Clients must have a valid certificate in order to authenticate via SASL EXTERNAL. For more information on creating and managing certificates, see the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or MozNSS documentation, depending on which TLS implementation libraries you are using.
16.1.1. Server Certificates

The DN of a server certificate must use the CN attribute to name the server, and the CN must carry the server's fully qualified domain name. Additional alias names and wildcards may be present in the subjectAltName certificate extension. More details on server certificate names are in RFC4513.
16.1.2. Client Certificates

The DN of a client certificate can be used directly as an authentication DN. Since X.509 is a part of the X.500 standard and LDAP is also based on X.500, both use the same DN formats and generally the DN in a user's X.509 certificate should be identical to the DN of their LDAP entry. However, sometimes the DNs may not be exactly the same, and so the mapping facility described in Mapping Authentication Identities can be applied to these DNs as well.
16.2. TLS Configuration

After obtaining the required certificates, a number of options must be configured on both the client and the server to enable TLS and make use of the certificates. At a minimum, the clients must be configured with the name of the file containing all of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates it will trust. The server must be configured with the CA certificates and also its own server certificate and private key.

Typically a single CA will have issued the server certificate and all of the trusted client certificates, so the server only needs to trust that one signing CA. However, a client may wish to connect to a variety of secure servers managed by different organizations, with server certificates generated by many different CAs. As such, a client is likely to need a list of many different trusted CAs in its configuration.
16.2.1. Server Configuration

The configuration directives for slapd belong in the global directives section of slapd.conf(5).
16.2.1.1. TLSCACertificateFile <filename>

This directive specifies the PEM-format file containing certificates for the CA's that slapd will trust. The certificate for the CA that signed the server certificate must be included among these certificates. If the signing CA was not a top-level (root) CA, certificates for the entire sequence of CA's from the signing CA to the top-level CA should be present. Multiple certificates are simply appended to the file; the order is not significant.
16.2.1.2. TLSCACertificatePath <path>

This directive specifies the path of a directory that contains individual CA certificates in separate files. In addition, this directory must be specially managed using the OpenSSL c_rehash utility. When using this feature, the OpenSSL library will attempt to locate certificate files based on a hash of their name and serial number. The c_rehash utility is used to generate symbolic links with the hashed names that point to the actual certificate files. As such, this option can only be used with a filesystem that actually supports symbolic links. In general, it is simpler to use the TLSCACertificateFile directive instead.

When using Mozilla NSS, this directive can be used to specify the path of the directory containing the NSS certificate and key database files. The certutil command can be used to add a CA certificate:

        certutil -d <path> -A -n "name of CA cert" -t CT,, -a -i /path/to/cacertfile.pem
    
    This command will add a CA certficate stored in the PEM (ASCII) formatted
    file named /path/to/cacertfile.pem. -t CT,, means that the certificate is
    trusted to be a CA issuing certs for use in TLS clients and servers.

16.2.1.3. TLSCertificateFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the slapd server certificate. Certificates are generally public information and require no special protection.

When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified with TLSCACertificatePath), this directive specifies the name of the certificate to use:

       TLSCertificateFile Server-Cert
    
    If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify the
    token name first, followed by a colon:
    
       TLSCertificateFile my hardware device:Server-Cert
    
    Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
    
       certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L

16.2.1.4. TLSCertificateKeyFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the TLSCertificateFile file. Private keys themselves are sensitive data and are usually password encrypted for protection. However, the current implementation doesn't support encrypted keys so the key must not be encrypted and the file itself must be protected carefully.

When using Mozilla NSS, this directive specifies the name of a file that contains the password for the key for the certificate specified with TLSCertificateFile. The modutil command can be used to turn off password protection for the cert/key database. For example, if TLSCACertificatePath specifes /etc/openldap/certdb as the location of the cert/key database, use modutil to change the password to the empty string:

        modutil -dbdir /etc/openldap/certdb -changepw 'NSS Certificate DB'
    
    You must have the old password, if any. Ignore the WARNING about the running
    browser. Press 'Enter' for the new password.

16.2.1.5. TLSCipherSuite <cipher-suite-spec>

This directive configures what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order. <cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher specification for OpenSSL. You can use the command

        openssl ciphers -v ALL

to obtain a verbose list of available cipher specifications.

Besides the individual cipher names, the specifiers HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, EXPORT, and EXPORT40 may be helpful, along with TLSv1, SSLv3, and SSLv2.

To obtain the list of ciphers in GnuTLS use:

        gnutls-cli -l

When using Mozilla NSS, the OpenSSL cipher suite specifications are used and translated into the format used internally by Mozilla NSS. There isn't an easy way to list the cipher suites from the command line. The authoritative list is in the source code for Mozilla NSS in the file sslinfo.c in the structure

       static const SSLCipherSuiteInfo suiteInfo[]

16.2.1.6. TLSRandFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file to obtain random bits from when /dev/urandom is not available. If the system provides /dev/urandom then this option is not needed, otherwise a source of random data must be configured. Some systems (e.g. Linux) provide /dev/urandom by default, while others (e.g. Solaris) require the installation of a patch to provide it, and others may not support it at all. In the latter case, EGD or PRNGD should be installed, and this directive should specify the name of the EGD/PRNGD socket. The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used to specify the filename. Also, in the absence of these options, the .rnd file in the slapd user's home directory may be used if it exists. To use the .rnd file, just create the file and copy a few hundred bytes of arbitrary data into the file. The file is only used to provide a seed for the pseudo-random number generator, and it doesn't need very much data to work.

This directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
16.2.1.7. TLSEphemeralDHParamFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains parameters for Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange. This is required in order to use a DSA certificate on the server side (i.e. TLSCertificateKeyFile points to a DSA key). Multiple sets of parameters can be included in the file; all of them will be processed. Parameters can be generated using the following command

        openssl dhparam [-dsaparam] -out <filename> <numbits>

This directive is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
16.2.1.8. TLSVerifyClient { never | allow | try | demand }

This directive specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an incoming TLS session, if any. This option is set to never by default, in which case the server never asks the client for a certificate. With a setting of allow the server will ask for a client certificate; if none is provided the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided but the server is unable to verify it, the certificate is ignored and the session proceeds normally, as if no certificate had been provided. With a setting of try the certificate is requested, and if none is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided and it cannot be verified, the session is immediately terminated. With a setting of demand the certificate is requested and a valid certificate must be provided, otherwise the session is immediately terminated.

Note: The server must request a client certificate in order to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a TLS session. As such, a non-default TLSVerifyClient setting must be configured before SASL EXTERNAL authentication may be attempted, and the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will only be offered to the client if a valid client certificate was received.

16.2.2. Client Configuration

Most of the client configuration directives parallel the server directives. The names of the directives are different, and they go into ldap.conf(5) instead of slapd.conf(5), but their functionality is mostly the same. Also, while most of these options may be configured on a system-wide basis, they may all be overridden by individual users in their .ldaprc files.

The LDAP Start TLS operation is used in LDAP to initiate TLS negotiation. All OpenLDAP command line tools support a -Z and -ZZ flag to indicate whether a Start TLS operation is to be issued. The latter flag indicates that the tool is to cease processing if TLS cannot be started while the former allows the command to continue.

In LDAPv2 environments, TLS is normally started using the LDAP Secure URI scheme (ldaps://) instead of the normal LDAP URI scheme (ldap://). OpenLDAP command line tools allow either scheme to used with the -H flag and with the URI ldap.conf(5) option.
16.2.2.1. TLS_CACERT <filename>

This is equivalent to the server's TLSCACertificateFile option. As noted in the TLS Configuration section, a client typically may need to know about more CAs than a server, but otherwise the same considerations apply.
16.2.2.2. TLS_CACERTDIR <path>

This is equivalent to the server's TLSCACertificatePath option. The specified directory must be managed with the OpenSSL c_rehash utility as well. If using Mozilla NSS, <path> may contain a cert/key database.
16.2.2.3. TLS_CERT <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the client certificate. This is a user-only directive and can only be specified in a user's .ldaprc file.

When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified with TLS_CACERTDIR), this directive specifies the name of the certificate to use:

       TLS_CERT Certificate for Sam Carter
    
    If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify the
    token name first, followed by a colon:
    
       TLS_CERT my hardware device:Certificate for Sam Carter
    
    Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
    
       certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L

16.2.2.4. TLS_KEY <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the TLS_CERT file. The same constraints mentioned for TLSCertificateKeyFile apply here. This is also a user-only directive.
16.2.2.5. TLS_RANDFILE <filename>

This directive is the same as the server's TLSRandFile option.
16.2.2.6. TLS_REQCERT { never | allow | try | demand }

This directive is equivalent to the server's TLSVerifyClient option. However, for clients the default value is demand and there generally is no good reason to change this setting.

17. Constructing a Distributed Directory Service

For many sites, running one or more slapd(8) that hold an entire subtree of data is sufficient. But often it is desirable to have one slapd refer to other directory services for a certain part of the tree (which may or may not be running slapd).

slapd supports subordinate and superior knowledge information. Subordinate knowledge information is held in referral objects (RFC3296).
17.1. Subordinate Knowledge Information

Subordinate knowledge information may be provided to delegate a subtree. Subordinate knowledge information is maintained in the directory as a special referral object at the delegate point. The referral object acts as a delegation point, gluing two services together. This mechanism allows for hierarchical directory services to be constructed.

A referral object has a structural object class of referral and has the same Distinguished Name as the delegated subtree. Generally, the referral object will also provide the auxiliary object class extensibleObject. This allows the entry to contain appropriate Relative Distinguished Name values. This is best demonstrated by example.

If the server a.example.net holds dc=example,dc=net and wished to delegate the subtree ou=subtree,dc=example,dc=net to another server b.example.net, the following named referral object would be added to a.example.net:

        dn: dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=net
        objectClass: referral
        objectClass: extensibleObject
        dc: subtree
        ref: ldap://b.example.net/dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=net

The server uses this information to generate referrals and search continuations to subordinate servers.

For those familiar with X.500, a named referral object is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a subr DSE.
17.2. Superior Knowledge Information

Superior knowledge information may be specified using the referral directive. The value is a list of URIs referring to superior directory services. For servers without immediate superiors, such as for a.example.net in the example above, the server can be configured to use a directory service with global knowledge, such as the OpenLDAP Root Service (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=393).

        referral        ldap://root.openldap.org/

However, as a.example.net is the immediate superior to b.example.net, b.example.net would be configured as follows:

        referral        ldap://a.example.net/

The server uses this information to generate referrals for operations acting upon entries not within or subordinate to any of the naming contexts held by the server.

For those familiar with X.500, this use of the ref attribute is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a Supr DSE.
17.3. The ManageDsaIT Control

Adding, modifying, and deleting referral objects is generally done using ldapmodify(1) or similar tools which support the ManageDsaIT control. The ManageDsaIT control informs the server that you intend to manage the referral object as a regular entry. This keeps the server from sending a referral result for requests which interrogate or update referral objects.

The ManageDsaIT control should not be specified when managing regular entries.

The -M option of ldapmodify(1) (and other tools) enables ManageDsaIT. For example:

        ldapmodify -M -f referral.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=net" -W

or with ldapsearch(1):

        ldapsearch -M -b "dc=example,dc=net" -x "(objectclass=referral)" '*' ref

Note: the ref attribute is operational and must be explicitly requested when desired in search results.

Note: the use of referrals to construct a Distributed Directory Service is extremely clumsy and not well supported by common clients. If an existing installation has already been built using referrals, the use of the chain overlay to hide the referrals will greatly improve the usability of the Directory system. A better approach would be to use explicitly defined local and proxy databases in subordinate configurations to provide a seamless view of the Distributed Directory.

Note: LDAP operations, even subtree searches, normally access only one database. That can be changed by gluing databases together with the subordinate/olcSubordinate keyword. Please see slapd.conf(5) and slapd-config(5).

18. Replication

Replicated directories are a fundamental requirement for delivering a resilient enterprise deployment.

OpenLDAP has various configuration options for creating a replicated directory. In previous releases, replication was discussed in terms of a master server and some number of slave servers. A master accepted directory updates from other clients, and a slave only accepted updates from a (single) master. The replication structure was rigidly defined and any particular database could only fulfill a single role, either master or slave.

As OpenLDAP now supports a wide variety of replication topologies, these terms have been deprecated in favor of provider and consumer: A provider replicates directory updates to consumers; consumers receive replication updates from providers. Unlike the rigidly defined master/slave relationships, provider/consumer roles are quite fluid: replication updates received in a consumer can be further propagated by that consumer to other servers, so a consumer can also act simultaneously as a provider. Also, a consumer need not be an actual LDAP server; it may be just an LDAP client.

The following sections will describe the replication technology and discuss the various replication options that are available.
18.1. Replication Technology
18.1.1. LDAP Sync Replication

The LDAP Sync Replication engine, syncrepl for short, is a consumer-side replication engine that enables the consumer LDAP server to maintain a shadow copy of a DIT fragment. A syncrepl engine resides at the consumer and executes as one of the slapd(8) threads. It creates and maintains a consumer replica by connecting to the replication provider to perform the initial DIT content load followed either by periodic content polling or by timely updates upon content changes.

Syncrepl uses the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol (or LDAP Sync for short) as the replica synchronization protocol. LDAP Sync provides a stateful replication which supports both pull-based and push-based synchronization and does not mandate the use of a history store. In pull-based replication the consumer periodically polls the provider for updates. In push-based replication the consumer listens for updates that are sent by the provider in realtime. Since the protocol does not require a history store, the provider does not need to maintain any log of updates it has received (Note that the syncrepl engine is extensible and additional replication protocols may be supported in the future.).

Syncrepl keeps track of the status of the replication content by maintaining and exchanging synchronization cookies. Because the syncrepl consumer and provider maintain their content status, the consumer can poll the provider content to perform incremental synchronization by asking for the entries required to make the consumer replica up-to-date with the provider content. Syncrepl also enables convenient management of replicas by maintaining replica status. The consumer replica can be constructed from a consumer-side or a provider-side backup at any synchronization status. Syncrepl can automatically resynchronize the consumer replica up-to-date with the current provider content.

Syncrepl supports both pull-based and push-based synchronization. In its basic refreshOnly synchronization mode, the provider uses pull-based synchronization where the consumer servers need not be tracked and no history information is maintained. The information required for the provider to process periodic polling requests is contained in the synchronization cookie of the request itself. To optimize the pull-based synchronization, syncrepl utilizes the present phase of the LDAP Sync protocol as well as its delete phase, instead of falling back on frequent full reloads. To further optimize the pull-based synchronization, the provider can maintain a per-scope session log as a history store. In its refreshAndPersist mode of synchronization, the provider uses a push-based synchronization. The provider keeps track of the consumer servers that have requested a persistent search and sends them necessary updates as the provider replication content gets modified.

With syncrepl, a consumer server can create a replica without changing the provider's configurations and without restarting the provider server, if the consumer server has appropriate access privileges for the DIT fragment to be replicated. The consumer server can stop the replication also without the need for provider-side changes and restart.

Syncrepl supports partial, sparse, and fractional replications. The shadow DIT fragment is defined by a general search criteria consisting of base, scope, filter, and attribute list. The replica content is also subject to the access privileges of the bind identity of the syncrepl replication connection.
18.1.1.1. The LDAP Content Synchronization Protocol

The LDAP Sync protocol allows a client to maintain a synchronized copy of a DIT fragment. The LDAP Sync operation is defined as a set of controls and other protocol elements which extend the LDAP search operation. This section introduces the LDAP Content Sync protocol only briefly. For more information, refer to RFC4533.

The LDAP Sync protocol supports both polling and listening for changes by defining two respective synchronization operations: refreshOnly and refreshAndPersist. Polling is implemented by the refreshOnly operation. The consumer polls the provider using an LDAP Search request with an LDAP Sync control attached. The consumer copy is synchronized to the provider copy at the time of polling using the information returned in the search. The provider finishes the search operation by returning SearchResultDone at the end of the search operation as in the normal search. Listening is implemented by the refreshAndPersist operation. As the name implies, it begins with a search, like refreshOnly. Instead of finishing the search after returning all entries currently matching the search criteria, the synchronization search remains persistent in the provider. Subsequent updates to the synchronization content in the provider cause additional entry updates to be sent to the consumer.

The refreshOnly operation and the refresh stage of the refreshAndPersist operation can be performed with a present phase or a delete phase.

In the present phase, the provider sends the consumer the entries updated within the search scope since the last synchronization. The provider sends all requested attributes, be they changed or not, of the updated entries. For each unchanged entry which remains in the scope, the provider sends a present message consisting only of the name of the entry and the synchronization control representing state present. The present message does not contain any attributes of the entry. After the consumer receives all update and present entries, it can reliably determine the new consumer copy by adding the entries added to the provider, by replacing the entries modified at the provider, and by deleting entries in the consumer copy which have not been updated nor specified as being present at the provider.

The transmission of the updated entries in the delete phase is the same as in the present phase. The provider sends all the requested attributes of the entries updated within the search scope since the last synchronization to the consumer. In the delete phase, however, the provider sends a delete message for each entry deleted from the search scope, instead of sending present messages. The delete message consists only of the name of the entry and the synchronization control representing state delete. The new consumer copy can be determined by adding, modifying, and removing entries according to the synchronization control attached to the SearchResultEntry message.

In the case that the LDAP Sync provider maintains a history store and can determine which entries are scoped out of the consumer copy since the last synchronization time, the provider can use the delete phase. If the provider does not maintain any history store, cannot determine the scoped-out entries from the history store, or the history store does not cover the outdated synchronization state of the consumer, the provider should use the present phase. The use of the present phase is much more efficient than a full content reload in terms of the synchronization traffic. To reduce the synchronization traffic further, the LDAP Sync protocol also provides several optimizations such as the transmission of the normalized entryUUIDs and the transmission of multiple entryUUIDs in a single syncIdSet message.

At the end of the refreshOnly synchronization, the provider sends a synchronization cookie to the consumer as a state indicator of the consumer copy after the synchronization is completed. The consumer will present the received cookie when it requests the next incremental synchronization to the provider.

When refreshAndPersist synchronization is used, the provider sends a synchronization cookie at the end of the refresh stage by sending a Sync Info message with refreshDone=TRUE. It also sends a synchronization cookie by attaching it to SearchResultEntry messages generated in the persist stage of the synchronization search. During the persist stage, the provider can also send a Sync Info message containing the synchronization cookie at any time the provider wants to update the consumer-side state indicator.

In the LDAP Sync protocol, entries are uniquely identified by the entryUUID attribute value. It can function as a reliable identifier of the entry. The DN of the entry, on the other hand, can be changed over time and hence cannot be considered as the reliable identifier. The entryUUID is attached to each SearchResultEntry or SearchResultReference as a part of the synchronization control.
18.1.1.2. Syncrepl Details

The syncrepl engine utilizes both the refreshOnly and the refreshAndPersist operations of the LDAP Sync protocol. If a syncrepl specification is included in a database definition, slapd(8) launches a syncrepl engine as a slapd(8) thread and schedules its execution. If the refreshOnly operation is specified, the syncrepl engine will be rescheduled at the interval time after a synchronization operation is completed. If the refreshAndPersist operation is specified, the engine will remain active and process the persistent synchronization messages from the provider.

The syncrepl engine utilizes both the present phase and the delete phase of the refresh synchronization. It is possible to configure a session log in the provider which stores the entryUUIDs of a finite number of entries deleted from a database. Multiple replicas share the same session log. The syncrepl engine uses the delete phase if the session log is present and the state of the consumer server is recent enough that no session log entries are truncated after the last synchronization of the client. The syncrepl engine uses the present phase if no session log is configured for the replication content or if the consumer replica is too outdated to be covered by the session log. The current design of the session log store is memory based, so the information contained in the session log is not persistent over multiple provider invocations. It is not currently supported to access the session log store by using LDAP operations. It is also not currently supported to impose access control to the session log.

As a further optimization, even in the case the synchronization search is not associated with any session log, no entries will be transmitted to the consumer server when there has been no update in the replication context.

The syncrepl engine, which is a consumer-side replication engine, can work with any backends. The LDAP Sync provider can be configured as an overlay on any backend, but works best with the back-bdb back-hdb, or back-mdb backends.

The LDAP Sync provider maintains a contextCSN for each database as the current synchronization state indicator of the provider content. It is the largest entryCSN in the provider context such that no transactions for an entry having smaller entryCSN value remains outstanding. The contextCSN could not just be set to the largest issued entryCSN because entryCSN is obtained before a transaction starts and transactions are not committed in the issue order.

The provider stores the contextCSN of a context in the contextCSN attribute of the context suffix entry. The attribute is not written to the database after every update operation though; instead it is maintained primarily in memory. At database start time the provider reads the last saved contextCSN into memory and uses the in-memory copy exclusively thereafter. By default, changes to the contextCSN as a result of database updates will not be written to the database until the server is cleanly shut down. A checkpoint facility exists to cause the contextCSN to be written out more frequently if desired.

Note that at startup time, if the provider is unable to read a contextCSN from the suffix entry, it will scan the entire database to determine the value, and this scan may take quite a long time on a large database. When a contextCSN value is read, the database will still be scanned for any entryCSN values greater than it, to make sure the contextCSN value truly reflects the greatest committed entryCSN in the database. On databases which support inequality indexing, setting an eq index on the entryCSN attribute and configuring contextCSN checkpoints will greatly speed up this scanning step.

If no contextCSN can be determined by reading and scanning the database, a new value will be generated. Also, if scanning the database yielded a greater entryCSN than was previously recorded in the suffix entry's contextCSN attribute, a checkpoint will be immediately written with the new value.

The consumer also stores its replica state, which is the provider's contextCSN received as a synchronization cookie, in the contextCSN attribute of the suffix entry. The replica state maintained by a consumer server is used as the synchronization state indicator when it performs subsequent incremental synchronization with the provider server. It is also used as a provider-side synchronization state indicator when it functions as a secondary provider server in a cascading replication configuration. Since the consumer and provider state information are maintained in the same location within their respective databases, any consumer can be promoted to a provider (and vice versa) without any special actions.

Because a general search filter can be used in the syncrepl specification, some entries in the context may be omitted from the synchronization content. The syncrepl engine creates a glue entry to fill in the holes in the replica context if any part of the replica content is subordinate to the holes. The glue entries will not be returned in the search result unless ManageDsaIT control is provided.

Also as a consequence of the search filter used in the syncrepl specification, it is possible for a modification to remove an entry from the replication scope even though the entry has not been deleted on the provider. Logically the entry must be deleted on the consumer but in refreshOnly mode the provider cannot detect and propagate this change without the use of the session log on the provider.

For configuration, please see the Syncrepl section.
18.2. Deployment Alternatives

While the LDAP Sync specification only defines a narrow scope for replication, the OpenLDAP implementation is extremely flexible and supports a variety of operating modes to handle other scenarios not explicitly addressed in the spec.
18.2.1. Delta-syncrepl replication

    Disadvantages of LDAP Sync replication:

LDAP Sync replication is an object-based replication mechanism. When any attribute value in a replicated object is changed on the provider, each consumer fetches and processes the complete changed object, including both the changed and unchanged attribute values during replication. One advantage of this approach is that when multiple changes occur to a single object, the precise sequence of those changes need not be preserved; only the final state of the entry is significant. But this approach may have drawbacks when the usage pattern involves single changes to multiple objects.

For example, suppose you have a database consisting of 102,400 objects of 1 KB each. Further, suppose you routinely run a batch job to change the value of a single two-byte attribute value that appears in each of the 102,400 objects on the master. Not counting LDAP and TCP/IP protocol overhead, each time you run this job each consumer will transfer and process 100 MB of data to process 200KB of changes!

99.98% of the data that is transmitted and processed in a case like this will be redundant, since it represents values that did not change. This is a waste of valuable transmission and processing bandwidth and can cause an unacceptable replication backlog to develop. While this situation is extreme, it serves to demonstrate a very real problem that is encountered in some LDAP deployments.

    Where Delta-syncrepl comes in:

Delta-syncrepl, a changelog-based variant of syncrepl, is designed to address situations like the one described above. Delta-syncrepl works by maintaining a changelog of a selectable depth in a separate database on the provider. The replication consumer checks the changelog for the changes it needs and, as long as the changelog contains the needed changes, the consumer fetches the changes from the changelog and applies them to its database. If, however, a replica is too far out of sync (or completely empty), conventional syncrepl is used to bring it up to date and replication then switches back to the delta-syncrepl mode.

Note: since the database state is stored in both the changelog DB and the main DB on the provider, it is important to backup/restore both the changelog DB and the main DB using slapcat/slapadd when restoring a DB or copying it to another machine.

For configuration, please see the Delta-syncrepl section.
18.2.2. N-Way Multi-Master replication

Multi-Master replication is a replication technique using Syncrepl to replicate data to multiple provider ("Master") Directory servers.
18.2.2.1. Valid Arguments for Multi-Master replication

    If any provider fails, other providers will continue to accept updates
    Avoids a single point of failure
    Providers can be located in several physical sites i.e. distributed across the network/globe.
    Good for Automatic failover/High Availability

18.2.2.2. Invalid Arguments for Multi-Master replication

(These are often claimed to be advantages of Multi-Master replication but those claims are false):

    It has NOTHING to do with load balancing
    Providers must propagate writes to all the other servers, which means the network traffic and write load spreads across all of the servers the same as for single-master.
    Server utilization and performance are at best identical for Multi-Master and Single-Master replication; at worst Single-Master is superior because indexing can be tuned differently to optimize for the different usage patterns between the provider and the consumers.

18.2.2.3. Arguments against Multi-Master replication

    Breaks the data consistency guarantees of the directory model
    http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1240.html
    If connectivity with a provider is lost because of a network partition, then "automatic failover" can just compound the problem
    Typically, a particular machine cannot distinguish between losing contact with a peer because that peer crashed, or because the network link has failed
    If a network is partitioned and multiple clients start writing to each of the "masters" then reconciliation will be a pain; it may be best to simply deny writes to the clients that are partitioned from the single provider

For configuration, please see the N-Way Multi-Master section below
18.2.3. MirrorMode replication

MirrorMode is a hybrid configuration that provides all of the consistency guarantees of single-master replication, while also providing the high availability of multi-master. In MirrorMode two providers are set up to replicate from each other (as a multi-master configuration), but an external frontend is employed to direct all writes to only one of the two servers. The second provider will only be used for writes if the first provider crashes, at which point the frontend will switch to directing all writes to the second provider. When a crashed provider is repaired and restarted it will automatically catch up to any changes on the running provider and resync.
18.2.3.1. Arguments for MirrorMode

    Provides a high-availability (HA) solution for directory writes (replicas handle reads)
    As long as one provider is operational, writes can safely be accepted
    Provider nodes replicate from each other, so they are always up to date and can be ready to take over (hot standby)
    Syncrepl also allows the provider nodes to re-synchronize after any downtime

18.2.3.2. Arguments against MirrorMode

    MirrorMode is not what is termed as a Multi-Master solution. This is because writes have to go to just one of the mirror nodes at a time
    MirrorMode can be termed as Active-Active Hot-Standby, therefore an external server (slapd in proxy mode) or device (hardware load balancer) is needed to manage which provider is currently active
    Backups are managed slightly differently
        If backing up the Berkeley database itself and periodically backing up the transaction log files, then the same member of the mirror pair needs to be used to collect logfiles until the next database backup is taken

For configuration, please see the MirrorMode section below
18.2.4. Syncrepl Proxy Mode

While the LDAP Sync protocol supports both pull- and push-based replication, the push mode (refreshAndPersist) must still be initiated from the consumer before the provider can begin pushing changes. In some network configurations, particularly where firewalls restrict the direction in which connections can be made, a provider-initiated push mode may be needed.

This mode can be configured with the aid of the LDAP Backend (Backends and slapd-ldap(8)). Instead of running the syncrepl engine on the actual consumer, a slapd-ldap proxy is set up near (or collocated with) the provider that points to the consumer, and the syncrepl engine runs on the proxy.

For configuration, please see the Syncrepl Proxy section.
18.2.4.1. Replacing Slurpd

The old slurpd mechanism only operated in provider-initiated push mode. Slurpd replication was deprecated in favor of Syncrepl replication and has been completely removed from OpenLDAP 2.4.

The slurpd daemon was the original replication mechanism inherited from UMich's LDAP and operated in push mode: the master pushed changes to the slaves. It was replaced for many reasons, in brief:

    It was not reliable
        It was extremely sensitive to the ordering of records in the replog
        It could easily go out of sync, at which point manual intervention was required to resync the slave database with the master directory
        It wasn't very tolerant of unavailable servers. If a slave went down for a long time, the replog could grow to a size that was too large for slurpd to process
    It only worked in push mode
    It required stopping and restarting the master to add new slaves
    It only supported single master replication

Syncrepl has none of those weaknesses:

    Syncrepl is self-synchronizing; you can start with a consumer database in any state from totally empty to fully synced and it will automatically do the right thing to achieve and maintain synchronization
        It is completely insensitive to the order in which changes occur
        It guarantees convergence between the consumer and the provider content without manual intervention
        It can resynchronize regardless of how long a consumer stays out of contact with the provider
    Syncrepl can operate in either direction
    Consumers can be added at any time without touching anything on the provider
    Multi-master replication is supported

18.3. Configuring the different replication types
18.3.1. Syncrepl
18.3.1.1. Syncrepl configuration

Because syncrepl is a consumer-side replication engine, the syncrepl specification is defined in slapd.conf(5) of the consumer server, not in the provider server's configuration file. The initial loading of the replica content can be performed either by starting the syncrepl engine with no synchronization cookie or by populating the consumer replica by loading an LDIF file dumped as a backup at the provider.

When loading from a backup, it is not required to perform the initial loading from the up-to-date backup of the provider content. The syncrepl engine will automatically synchronize the initial consumer replica to the current provider content. As a result, it is not required to stop the provider server in order to avoid the replica inconsistency caused by the updates to the provider content during the content backup and loading process.

When replicating a large scale directory, especially in a bandwidth constrained environment, it is advised to load the consumer replica from a backup instead of performing a full initial load using syncrepl.
18.3.1.2. Set up the provider slapd

The provider is implemented as an overlay, so the overlay itself must first be configured in slapd.conf(5) before it can be used. The provider has only two configuration directives, for setting checkpoints on the contextCSN and for configuring the session log. Because the LDAP Sync search is subject to access control, proper access control privileges should be set up for the replicated content.

The contextCSN checkpoint is configured by the

        syncprov-checkpoint <ops> <minutes>

directive. Checkpoints are only tested after successful write operations. If <ops> operations or more than <minutes> time has passed since the last checkpoint, a new checkpoint is performed.

The session log is configured by the

        syncprov-sessionlog <size>

directive, where <size> is the maximum number of session log entries the session log can record. When a session log is configured, it is automatically used for all LDAP Sync searches within the database.

Note that using the session log requires searching on the entryUUID attribute. Setting an eq index on this attribute will greatly benefit the performance of the session log on the provider.

A more complete example of the slapd.conf(5) content is thus:

        database mdb
        maxsize 1073741824
        suffix dc=Example,dc=com
        rootdn dc=Example,dc=com
        directory /var/ldap/db
        index objectclass,entryCSN,entryUUID eq
    
        overlay syncprov
        syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
        syncprov-sessionlog 100

18.3.1.3. Set up the consumer slapd

The syncrepl replication is specified in the database section of slapd.conf(5) for the replica context. The syncrepl engine is backend independent and the directive can be defined with any database type.

        database mdb
        maxsize 1073741824
        suffix dc=Example,dc=com
        rootdn dc=Example,dc=com
        directory /var/ldap/db
        index objectclass,entryCSN,entryUUID eq
    
        syncrepl rid=123
                provider=ldap://provider.example.com:389
                type=refreshOnly
                interval=01:00:00:00
                searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                filter="(objectClass=organizationalPerson)"
                scope=sub
                attrs="cn,sn,ou,telephoneNumber,title,l"
                schemachecking=off
                bindmethod=simple
                binddn="cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com"
                credentials=secret

In this example, the consumer will connect to the provider slapd(8) at port 389 of ldap://provider.example.com to perform a polling (refreshOnly) mode of synchronization once a day. It will bind as cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com using simple authentication with password "secret". Note that the access control privilege of cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com should be set appropriately in the provider to retrieve the desired replication content. Also the search limits must be high enough on the provider to allow the syncuser to retrieve a complete copy of the requested content. The consumer uses the rootdn to write to its database so it always has full permissions to write all content.

The synchronization search in the above example will search for the entries whose objectClass is organizationalPerson in the entire subtree rooted at dc=example,dc=com. The requested attributes are cn, sn, ou, telephoneNumber, title, and l. The schema checking is turned off, so that the consumer slapd(8) will not enforce entry schema checking when it processes updates from the provider slapd(8).

For more detailed information on the syncrepl directive, see the syncrepl section of The slapd Configuration File chapter of this admin guide.
18.3.1.4. Start the provider and the consumer slapd

The provider slapd(8) is not required to be restarted. contextCSN is automatically generated as needed: it might be originally contained in the LDIF file, generated by slapadd (8), generated upon changes in the context, or generated when the first LDAP Sync search arrives at the provider. If an LDIF file is being loaded which did not previously contain the contextCSN, the -w option should be used with slapadd (8) to cause it to be generated. This will allow the server to startup a little quicker the first time it runs.

When starting a consumer slapd(8), it is possible to provide a synchronization cookie as the -c cookie command line option in order to start the synchronization from a specific state. The cookie is a comma separated list of name=value pairs. Currently supported syncrepl cookie fields are csn=<csn> and rid=<rid>. <csn> represents the current synchronization state of the consumer replica. <rid> identifies a consumer replica locally within the consumer server. It is used to relate the cookie to the syncrepl definition in slapd.conf(5) which has the matching replica identifier. The <rid> must have no more than 3 decimal digits. The command line cookie overrides the synchronization cookie stored in the consumer replica database.
18.3.2. Delta-syncrepl
18.3.2.1. Delta-syncrepl Provider configuration

Setting up delta-syncrepl requires configuration changes on both the master and replica servers:

     # Give the replica DN unlimited read access.  This ACL needs to be
     # merged with other ACL statements, and/or moved within the scope
     # of a database.  The "by * break" portion causes evaluation of
     # subsequent rules.  See slapd.access(5) for details.
     access to *
        by dn.base="cn=replicator,dc=symas,dc=com" read
        by * break
    
     # Set the module path location
     modulepath /opt/symas/lib/openldap
    
     # Load the hdb backend
     moduleload back_hdb.la
    
     # Load the accesslog overlay
     moduleload accesslog.la
    
     #Load the syncprov overlay
     moduleload syncprov.la
    
     # Accesslog database definitions
     database hdb
     suffix cn=accesslog
     directory /db/accesslog
     rootdn cn=accesslog
     index default eq
     index entryCSN,objectClass,reqEnd,reqResult,reqStart
    
     overlay syncprov
     syncprov-nopresent TRUE
     syncprov-reloadhint TRUE
    
     # Let the replica DN have limitless searches
     limits dn.exact="cn=replicator,dc=symas,dc=com" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited
    
     # Primary database definitions
     database hdb
     suffix "dc=symas,dc=com"
     rootdn "cn=manager,dc=symas,dc=com"
    
     ## Whatever other configuration options are desired
    
     # syncprov specific indexing
     index entryCSN eq
     index entryUUID eq
    
     # syncrepl Provider for primary db
     overlay syncprov
     syncprov-checkpoint 1000 60
    
     # accesslog overlay definitions for primary db
     overlay accesslog
     logdb cn=accesslog
     logops writes
     logsuccess TRUE
     # scan the accesslog DB every day, and purge entries older than 7 days
     logpurge 07+00:00 01+00:00
    
     # Let the replica DN have limitless searches
     limits dn.exact="cn=replicator,dc=symas,dc=com" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited

For more information, always consult the relevant man pages (slapo-accesslog(5) and slapd.conf(5))
18.3.2.2. Delta-syncrepl Consumer configuration

     # Replica database configuration
     database hdb
     suffix "dc=symas,dc=com"
     rootdn "cn=manager,dc=symas,dc=com"
    
     ## Whatever other configuration bits for the replica, like indexing
     ## that you want
    
     # syncrepl specific indices
     index entryUUID eq
    
     # syncrepl directives
     syncrepl  rid=0
               provider=ldap://ldapmaster.symas.com:389
               bindmethod=simple
               binddn="cn=replicator,dc=symas,dc=com"
               credentials=secret
               searchbase="dc=symas,dc=com"
               logbase="cn=accesslog"
               logfilter="(&(objectClass=auditWriteObject)(reqResult=0))"
               schemachecking=on
               type=refreshAndPersist
               retry="60 +"
               syncdata=accesslog
    
     # Refer updates to the master
     updateref               ldap://ldapmaster.symas.com

The above configuration assumes that you have a replicator identity defined in your database that can be used to bind to the provider. In addition, all of the databases (primary, replica, and the accesslog storage database) should also have properly tuned DB_CONFIG files that meet your needs.
18.3.3. N-Way Multi-Master

For the following example we will be using 3 Master nodes. Keeping in line with test050-syncrepl-multimaster of the OpenLDAP test suite, we will be configuring slapd(8) via cn=config

This sets up the config database:

     dn: cn=config
     objectClass: olcGlobal
     cn: config
     olcServerID: 1
    
     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     olcDatabase: {0}config
     olcRootPW: secret

second and third servers will have a different olcServerID obviously:

     dn: cn=config
     objectClass: olcGlobal
     cn: config
     olcServerID: 2
    
     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     olcDatabase: {0}config
     olcRootPW: secret

This sets up syncrepl as a provider (since these are all masters):

     dn: cn=module,cn=config
     objectClass: olcModuleList
     cn: module
     olcModulePath: /usr/local/libexec/openldap
     olcModuleLoad: syncprov.la

Now we setup the first Master Node (replace $URI1, $URI2 and $URI3 etc. with your actual ldap urls):

     dn: cn=config
     changetype: modify
     replace: olcServerID
     olcServerID: 1 $URI1
     olcServerID: 2 $URI2
     olcServerID: 3 $URI3
    
     dn: olcOverlay=syncprov,olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     changetype: add
     objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
     objectClass: olcSyncProvConfig
     olcOverlay: syncprov
    
     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     changetype: modify
     add: olcSyncRepl
     olcSyncRepl: rid=001 provider=$URI1 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=002 provider=$URI2 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=003 provider=$URI3 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     -
     add: olcMirrorMode
     olcMirrorMode: TRUE

Now start up the Master and a consumer/s, also add the above LDIF to the first consumer, second consumer etc. It will then replicate cn=config. You now have N-Way Multimaster on the config database.

We still have to replicate the actual data, not just the config, so add to the master (all active and configured consumers/masters will pull down this config, as they are all syncing). Also, replace all ${} variables with whatever is applicable to your setup:

     dn: olcDatabase={1}$BACKEND,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     objectClass: olc${BACKEND}Config
     olcDatabase: {1}$BACKEND
     olcSuffix: $BASEDN
     olcDbDirectory: ./db
     olcRootDN: $MANAGERDN
     olcRootPW: $PASSWD
     olcLimits: dn.exact="$MANAGERDN" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited
     olcSyncRepl: rid=004 provider=$URI1 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=005 provider=$URI2 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=006 provider=$URI3 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcMirrorMode: TRUE
    
     dn: olcOverlay=syncprov,olcDatabase={1}${BACKEND},cn=config
     changetype: add
     objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
     objectClass: olcSyncProvConfig
     olcOverlay: syncprov

Note: All of your servers' clocks must be tightly synchronized using e.g. NTP http://www.ntp.org/, atomic clock, or some other reliable time reference.

Note: As stated in slapd-config(5), URLs specified in olcSyncRepl directives are the URLs of the servers from which to replicate. These must exactly match the URLs slapd listens on (-h in Command-Line Options). Otherwise slapd may attempt to replicate from itself, causing a loop.

18.3.4. MirrorMode

MirrorMode configuration is actually very easy. If you have ever setup a normal slapd syncrepl provider, then the only change is the following two directives:

       mirrormode  on
       serverID    1

Note: You need to make sure that the serverID of each mirror node is different and add it as a global configuration option.

18.3.4.1. Mirror Node Configuration

The first step is to configure the syncrepl provider the same as in the Set up the provider slapd section.

Here's a specific cut down example using LDAP Sync Replication in refreshAndPersist mode:

MirrorMode node 1:

       # Global section
       serverID    1
       # database section
    
       # syncrepl directive
       syncrepl      rid=001
                     provider=ldap://ldap-sid2.example.com
                     bindmethod=simple
                     binddn="cn=mirrormode,dc=example,dc=com"
                     credentials=mirrormode
                     searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                     schemachecking=on
                     type=refreshAndPersist
                     retry="60 +"
    
       mirrormode on

MirrorMode node 2:

       # Global section
       serverID    2
       # database section
    
       # syncrepl directive
       syncrepl      rid=001
                     provider=ldap://ldap-sid1.example.com
                     bindmethod=simple
                     binddn="cn=mirrormode,dc=example,dc=com"
                     credentials=mirrormode
                     searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                     schemachecking=on
                     type=refreshAndPersist
                     retry="60 +"
    
       mirrormode on

It's simple really; each MirrorMode node is setup exactly the same, except that the serverID is unique, and each consumer is pointed to the other server.
18.3.4.1.1. Failover Configuration

There are generally 2 choices for this; 1. Hardware proxies/load-balancing or dedicated proxy software, 2. using a Back-LDAP proxy as a syncrepl provider

A typical enterprise example might be:

Figure X.Y: MirrorMode in a Dual Data Center Configuration
18.3.4.1.2. Normal Consumer Configuration

This is exactly the same as the Set up the consumer slapd section. It can either setup in normal syncrepl replication mode, or in delta-syncrepl replication mode.
18.3.4.2. MirrorMode Summary

You will now have a directory architecture that provides all of the consistency guarantees of single-master replication, while also providing the high availability of multi-master replication.
18.3.5. Syncrepl Proxy

Figure X.Y: Replacing slurpd

The following example is for a self-contained push-based replication solution:

        #######################################################################
        # Standard OpenLDAP Master/Provider

A replica configuration for this type of setup could be:

        database    monitor
    
        database    config
        rootpw          testing

You can see we use the updatedn directive here and example ACLs (usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.acl) for this could be:

        # Give the replica DN unlimited read access.  This ACL may need to be
        # merged with other ACL statements.
    
        access to *
             by dn.base="cn=replicator,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" write
             by * break
    
        access to dn.base=""
                by * read
    
        access to dn.base="cn=Subschema"
                by * read
    
        access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"
            by dn.exact="uid=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" write
            by users read
            by * none
    
        access to *
                by self write
                by * read

In order to support more replicas, just add more database ldap sections and increment the syncrepl rid number accordingly.

Note: You must populate the Master and Slave directories with the same data, unlike when using normal Syncrepl

If you do not have access to modify the master directory configuration you can configure a standalone ldap proxy, which might look like:

                        retry="5 5 300 5"
    
        overlay         syncprov

As you can see, you can let your imagination go wild using Syncrepl and slapd-ldap(8) tailoring your replication to fit your specific network topology.

19. Maintenance

System Administration is all about maintenance, so it is only fair that we discuss how to correctly maintain an OpenLDAP deployment.
19.1. Directory Backups

Backup strategies largely depend on the amount of change in the database and how much of that change an administrator might be willing to lose in a catastrophic failure. There are two basic methods that can be used:

1. Backup the Berkeley database itself and periodically back up the transaction log files:

Berkeley DB produces transaction logs that can be used to reconstruct changes from a given point in time. For example, if an administrator were willing to only lose one hour's worth of changes, they could take down the server in the middle of the night, copy the Berkeley database files offsite, and bring the server back online. Then, on an hourly basis, they could force a database checkpoint, capture the log files that have been generated in the past hour, and copy them offsite. The accumulated log files, in combination with the previous database backup, could be used with db_recover to reconstruct the database up to the time the last collection of log files was copied offsite. This method affords good protection, with minimal space overhead.

2. Periodically run slapcat and back up the LDIF file:

Slapcat can be run while slapd is active. However, one runs the risk of an inconsistent database- not from the point of slapd, but from the point of the applications using LDAP. For example, if a provisioning application performed tasks that consisted of several LDAP operations, and the slapcat took place concurrently with those operations, then there might be inconsistencies in the LDAP database from the point of view of that provisioning application and applications that depended on it. One must, therefore, be convinced something like that won't happen. One way to do that would be to put the database in read-only mode while performing the slapcat. The other disadvantage of this approach is that the generated LDIF files can be rather large and the accumulation of the day's backups could add up to a substantial amount of space.

You can use slapcat(8) to generate an LDIF file for each of your slapd(8) back-bdb or back-hdb databases.

    slapcat -f slapd.conf -b "dc=example,dc=com"

For back-bdb and back-hdb, this command may be ran while slapd(8) is running.

MORE on actual Berkeley DB backups later covering db_recover etc.
19.2. Berkeley DB Logs

Berkeley DB log files grow, and the administrator has to deal with it. The procedure is known as log file archival or log file rotation.

Note: The actual log file rotation is handled by the Berkeley DB engine.

Logs of current transactions need to be stored into files so that the database can be recovered in the event of an application crash. Administrators can change the size limit of a single log file (by default 10MB), and have old log files removed automatically, by setting up DB environment (see below). The reason Berkeley DB never deletes any log files by default is that the administrator may wish to backup the log files before removal to make database recovery possible even after a catastrophic failure, such as file system corruption.

Log file names are log.XXXXXXXXXX (X is a digit). By default the log files are located in the BDB backend directory. The db_archive tool knows what log files are used in current transactions, and what are not. Administrators can move unused log files to a backup media, and delete them. To have them removed automatically, place set_flags DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE directive in DB_CONFIG.

Note: If the log files are removed automatically, recovery after a catastrophic failure is likely to be impossible.

The files with names __db.001, __db.002, etc are just shared memory regions (or whatever). These ARE NOT 'logs', they must be left alone. Don't be afraid of them, they do not grow like logs do.

To understand the db_archive interface, the reader should refer to chapter 9 of the Berkeley DB guide. In particular, the following chapters are recommended:

    Database and log file archival - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/transapp/archival.html
    Log file removal - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/transapp/logfile.html
    Recovery procedures - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/transapp/recovery.html
    Hot failover - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/transapp/hotfail.html
    Complete list of Berkeley DB flags - http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/api_c/env_set_flags.html

Advanced installations can use special environment settings to fine-tune some Berkeley DB options (change the log file limit, etc). This can be done by using the DB_CONFIG file. This magic file can be created in BDB backend directory set up by slapd.conf(5). More information on this file can be found in File naming chapter. Specific directives can be found in C Interface, look for DB_ENV->set_XXXX calls.

Note: options set in DB_CONFIG file override options set by OpenLDAP. Use them with extreme caution. Do not use them unless You know what You are doing.

The advantages of DB_CONFIG usage can be the following:

    to keep data files and log files on different mediums (i.e. disks) to improve performance and/or reliability;
    to fine-tune some specific options (such as shared memory region sizes);
    to set the log file limit (please read Log file limits before doing this).

To figure out the best-practice BDB backup scenario, the reader is highly recommended to read the whole Chapter 9: Berkeley DB Transactional Data Store Applications. This chapter is a set of small pages with examples in C language. Non-programming people can skip these examples without loss of knowledge.
19.3. Checkpointing

MORE/TIDY

If you put "checkpoint 1024 5" in slapd.conf (to checkpoint after 1024kb or 5 minutes, for example), this does not checkpoint every 5 minutes as you may think. The explanation from Howard is:

'In OpenLDAP 2.1 and 2.2 the checkpoint directive acts as follows - *when there is a write operation*, and more than <check> minutes have occurred since the last checkpoint, perform the checkpoint. If more than <check> minutes pass after a write without any other write operations occurring, no checkpoint is performed, so it's possible to lose the last write that occurred.''

In other words, a write operation occurring less than "check" minutes after the last checkpoint will not be checkpointed until the next write occurs after "check" minutes have passed since the checkpoint.

This has been modified in 2.3 to indeed checkpoint every so often; in the meantime a workaround is to invoke "db_checkpoint" from a cron script every so often, say 5 minutes.
19.4. Migration

The simplest steps needed to migrate between versions or upgrade, depending on your deployment type are:



    Stop the current server when convenient
    
    slapcat the current data out
    
    Clear out the current data directory (/usr/local/var/openldap-data/) leaving DB_CONFIG in place
    
    Perform the software upgrades
    
    slapadd the exported data back into the directory
    
    Start the server

Obviously this doesn't cater for any complicated deployments like MirrorMode or N-Way Multi-Master, but following the above sections and using either commercial support or community support should help. Also check the Troubleshooting section.

20. Monitoring

slapd(8) supports an optional LDAP monitoring interface you can use to obtain information regarding the current state of your slapd instance. For instance, the interface allows you to determine how many clients are connected to the server currently. The monitoring information is provided by a specialized backend, the monitor backend. A manual page, slapd-monitor(5) is available.

When the monitoring interface is enabled, LDAP clients may be used to access information provided by the monitor backend, subject to access and other controls.

When enabled, the monitor backend dynamically generates and returns objects in response to search requests in the cn=Monitor subtree. Each object contains information about a particular aspect of the server. The information is held in a combination of user applications and operational attributes. This information can be access with ldapsearch(1), with any general-purpose LDAP browser, or with specialized monitoring tools. The Accessing Monitoring Information section provides a brief tutorial on how to use ldapsearch(1) to access monitoring information, while the Monitor information section details monitoring information base and its organization.

While support for the monitor backend is included in default builds of slapd(8), this support requires some configuration to become active. This may be done using either cn=config or slapd.conf(5). The former is discussed in the Monitor configuration via cn=config section of this of this chapter. The latter is discussed in the Monitor configuration via slapd.conf(5) section of this chapter. These sections assume monitor backend is built into slapd (e.g., --enable-monitor=yes, the default). If the monitor backend was built as a module (e.g., --enable-monitor=mod, this module must loaded. Loading of modules is discussed in the Configuring slapd and The slapd Configuration File chapters.
20.1. Monitor configuration via cn=config(5)

This section has yet to be written.
20.2. Monitor configuration via slapd.conf(5)

Configuration of the slapd.conf(5) to support LDAP monitoring is quite simple.

First, ensure core.schema schema configuration file is included by your slapd.conf(5) file. The monitor backend requires it.

Second, instantiate the monitor backend by adding a database monitor directive below your existing database sections. For instance:

        database monitor

Lastly, add additional global or database directives as needed.

Like most other database backends, the monitor backend does honor slapd(8) access and other administrative controls. As some monitor information may be sensitive, it is generally recommend access to cn=monitor be restricted to directory administrators and their monitoring agents. Adding an access directive immediately below the database monitor directive is a clear and effective approach for controlling access. For instance, the addition of the following access directive immediately below the database monitor directive restricts access to monitoring information to the specified directory manager.

        access to *
                by dn.exact="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
                by * none

More information on slapd(8) access controls, see The access Control Directive section of the The slapd Configuration File chapter and slapd.access(5).

After restarting slapd(8), you are ready to start exploring the monitoring information provided in cn=config as discussed in the Accessing Monitoring Information section of this chapter.

One can verify slapd(8) is properly configured to provide monitoring information by attempting to read the cn=monitor object. For instance, if the following ldapsearch(1) command returns the cn=monitor object (with, as requested, no attributes), it's working.

        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W \
                -b 'cn=Monitor' -s base 1.1

Note that unlike general purpose database backends, the database suffix is hardcoded. It's always cn=Monitor. So no suffix directive should be provided. Also note that general purpose database backends, the monitor backend cannot be instantiated multiple times. That is, there can only be one (or zero) occurrences of database monitor in the server's configuration.
20.3. Accessing Monitoring Information

As previously discussed, when enabled, the monitor backend dynamically generates and returns objects in response to search requests in the cn=Monitor subtree. Each object contains information about a particular aspect of the server. The information is held in a combination of user applications and operational attributes. This information can be access with ldapsearch(1), with any general-purpose LDAP browser, or with specialized monitoring tools.

This section provides a provides a brief tutorial on how to use ldapsearch(1) to access monitoring information.

To inspect any particular monitor object, one performs search operation on the object with a baseObject scope and a (objectClass=*) filter. As the monitoring information is contained in a combination of user applications and operational attributes, the return all user applications attributes (e.g., '*') and all operational attributes (e.g., '+') should be requested. For instance, to read the cn=Monitor object itself, the ldapsearch(1) command (modified to fit your configuration) can be used:

        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W \
                -b 'cn=Monitor' -s base '(objectClass=*)' '*' '+'

When run against your server, this should produce output similar to:

        dn: cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorServer
        structuralObjectClass: monitorServer
        cn: Monitor
        creatorsName:
        modifiersName:
        createTimestamp: 20061208223558Z
        modifyTimestamp: 20061208223558Z
        description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
        description: This object contains information about this server.
        description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
         must be explicitly requested.
        monitoredInfo: OpenLDAP: slapd 2.4 (Dec  7 2006 17:30:29)
        entryDN: cn=Monitor
        subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
        hasSubordinates: TRUE

To reduce the number of uninteresting attributes returned, one can be more selective when requesting which attributes are to be returned. For instance, one could request the return of all attributes allowed by the monitorServer object class (e.g., @objectClass) instead of all user and all operational attributes:

        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W \
                -b 'cn=Monitor' -s base '(objectClass=*)' '@monitorServer'

This limits the output as follows:

        dn: cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorServer
        cn: Monitor
        description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
        description: This object contains information about this server.
        description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
         must be explicitly requested.
        monitoredInfo: OpenLDAP: slapd 2.X (Dec  7 2006 17:30:29)

To return the names of all the monitoring objects, one performs a search of cn=Monitor with subtree scope and (objectClass=*) filter and requesting no attributes (e.g., 1.1) be returned.

        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W -b 'cn=Monitor' -s sub 1.1

If you run this command you will discover that there are many objects in the cn=Monitor subtree. The following section describes some of the commonly available monitoring objects.
20.4. Monitor Information

The monitor backend provides a wealth of information useful for monitoring the slapd(8) contained in set of monitor objects. Each object contains information about a particular aspect of the server, such as a backends, a connection, or a thread. Some objects serve as containers for other objects and used to construct a hierarchy of objects.

In this hierarchy, the most superior object is {cn=Monitor}. While this object primarily serves as a container for other objects, most of which are containers, this object provides information about this server. In particular, it provides the slapd(8) version string. Example:

        dn: cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: OpenLDAP: slapd 2.X (Dec  7 2006 17:30:29)

Note: Examples in this section (and its subsections) have been trimmed to show only key information.

20.4.1. Backends

The cn=Backends,cn=Monitor object, itself, provides a list of available backends. The list of available backends all builtin backends, as well as backends loaded by modules. For example:

        dn: cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: config
        monitoredInfo: ldif
        monitoredInfo: monitor
        monitoredInfo: bdb
        monitoredInfo: hdb

This indicates the config, ldif, monitor, bdb, and hdb backends are available.

The cn=Backends,cn=Monitor object is also a container for available backend objects. Each available backend object contains information about a particular backend. For example:

        dn: cn=Backend 0,cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: config
        monitorRuntimeConfig: TRUE

20.4.2. Connections

The main entry is empty; it should contain some statistics on the number of connections.

Dynamic child entries are created for each open connection, with stats on the activity on that connection (the format will be detailed later). There are two special child entries that show the number of total and current connections respectively.

For example:

Total Connections:

   dn: cn=Total,cn=Connections,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitorCounterObject
   monitorCounter: 4
   entryDN: cn=Total,cn=Connections,cn=Monitor
   subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
   hasSubordinates: FALSE

Current Connections:

   dn: cn=Current,cn=Connections,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitorCounterObject
   monitorCounter: 2
   entryDN: cn=Current,cn=Connections,cn=Monitor
   subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
   hasSubordinates: FALSE

20.4.3. Databases

The main entry contains the naming context of each configured database; the child entries contain, for each database, the type and the naming context.

For example:

   dn: cn=Database 2,cn=Databases,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitoredObject
   monitoredInfo: monitor
   monitorIsShadow: FALSE
   monitorContext: cn=Monitor
   readOnly: FALSE
   entryDN: cn=Database 2,cn=Databases,cn=Monitor
   subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
   hasSubordinates: FALSE

20.4.4. Listener

   dn: cn=Listener 0,cn=Listeners,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitoredObject
   monitorConnectionLocalAddress: IP=0.0.0.0:389
   entryDN: cn=Listener 0,cn=Listeners,cn=Monitor
   subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
   hasSubordinates: FALSE

20.4.5. Log

It contains the currently active log items. The Log subsystem allows user modify operations on the description attribute, whose values MUST be in the list of admittable log switches:

   Trace
   Packets
   Args
   Conns
   BER
   Filter
   Config
   ACL
   Stats
   Stats2
   Shell
   Parse
   Sync

These values can be added, replaced or deleted; they affect what messages are sent to the syslog device. Custom values could be added by custom modules.
20.4.6. Operations

It shows some statistics on the operations performed by the server:

   Initiated
   Completed

and for each operation type, i.e.:

   Bind
   Unbind
   Add
   Delete
   Modrdn
   Modify
   Compare
   Search
   Abandon
   Extended

There are too many types to list example here, so please try for yourself using Monitor search example
20.4.7. Overlays

The main entry contains the type of overlays available at run-time; the child entries, for each overlay, contain the type of the overlay.

It should also contain the modules that have been loaded if dynamic overlays are enabled:

   # Overlays, Monitor
   dn: cn=Overlays,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitorContainer
   monitoredInfo: syncprov
   monitoredInfo: accesslog

21. Tuning

This is perhaps one of the most important chapters in the guide, because if you have not tuned slapd(8) correctly or grasped how to design your directory and environment, you can expect very poor performance.

Reading, understanding and experimenting using the instructions and information in the following sections, will enable you to fully understand how to tailor your directory server to your specific requirements.

It should be noted that the following information has been collected over time from our community based FAQ. So obviously the benefit of this real world experience and advice should be of great value to the reader.
21.1. Performance Factors

Various factors can play a part in how your directory performs on your chosen hardware and environment. We will attempt to discuss these here.
21.1.1. Memory

Scale your cache to use available memory and increase system memory if you can.

See Caching for BDB cache tuning hints. Note that LMDB uses no cache of its own and has no tuning options, so the Caching section can be ignored when using LMDB.
21.1.2. Disks

Use fast filesystems, and conduct your own testing to see which filesystem types perform best with your workload. (On our own Linux testing, EXT2 and JFS tend to provide better write performance than everything else, including newer filesystems like EXT4, BTRFS, etc.)

Use fast subsystems. Put each database and logs on separate disks (for BDB this is configurable via DB_CONFIG):

       # Data Directory
       set_data_dir /data/db
    
       # Transaction Log settings
       set_lg_dir /logs

21.1.3. Network Topology

http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/363.html

Drawing here.
21.1.4. Directory Layout Design

Reference to other sections and good/bad drawing here.
21.1.5. Expected Usage

Discussion.
21.2. Indexes
21.2.1. Understanding how a search works

If you're searching on a filter that has been indexed, then the search reads the index and pulls exactly the entries that are referenced by the index. If the filter term has not been indexed, then the search must read every single entry in the target scope and test to see if each entry matches the filter. Obviously indexing can save a lot of work when it's used correctly.
21.2.2. What to index

You should create indices to match the actual filter terms used in search queries.

        index cn,sn,givenname,mail eq

Each attribute index can be tuned further by selecting the set of index types to generate. For example, substring and approximate search for organizations (o) may make little sense (and isn't like done very often). And searching for userPassword likely makes no sense what so ever.

General rule: don't go overboard with indexes. Unused indexes must be maintained and hence can only slow things down.

See slapd.conf(8) and slapdindex(8) for more information
21.2.3. Presence indexing

If your client application uses presence filters and if the target attribute exists on the majority of entries in your target scope, then all of those entries are going to be read anyway, because they are valid members of the result set. In a subtree where 100% of the entries are going to contain the same attributes, the presence index does absolutely NOTHING to benefit the search, because 100% of the entries match that presence filter.

So the resource cost of generating the index is a complete waste of CPU time, disk, and memory. Don't do it unless you know that it will be used, and that the attribute in question occurs very infrequently in the target data.

Almost no applications use presence filters in their search queries. Presence indexing is pointless when the target attribute exists on the majority of entries in the database. In most LDAP deployments, presence indexing should not be done, it's just wasted overhead.

See the Logging section below on what to watch our for if you have a frequently searched for attribute that is unindexed.
21.3. Logging
21.3.1. What log level to use

The default of loglevel stats (256) is really the best bet. There's a corollary to this when problems *do* arise, don't try to trace them using syslog. Use the debug flag instead, and capture slapd's stderr output. syslog is too slow for debug tracing, and it's inherently lossy - it will throw away messages when it can't keep up.

Contrary to popular belief, loglevel 0 is not ideal for production as you won't be able to track when problems first arise.
21.3.2. What to watch out for

The most common message you'll see that you should pay attention to is:

       "<= bdb_equality_candidates: (foo) index_param failed (18)"

That means that some application tried to use an equality filter (foo=<somevalue>) and attribute foo does not have an equality index. If you see a lot of these messages, you should add the index. If you see one every month or so, it may be acceptable to ignore it.

The default syslog level is stats (256) which logs the basic parameters of each request; it usually produces 1-3 lines of output. On Solaris and systems that only provide synchronous syslog, you may want to turn it off completely, but usually you want to leave it enabled so that you'll be able to see index messages whenever they arise. On Linux you can configure syslogd to run asynchronously, in which case the performance hit for moderate syslog traffic pretty much disappears.
21.3.3. Improving throughput

You can improve logging performance on some systems by configuring syslog not to sync the file system with every write (man syslogd/syslog.conf). In Linux, you can prepend the log file name with a "-" in syslog.conf. For example, if you are using the default LOCAL4 logging you could try:

       # LDAP logs
       LOCAL4.*         -/var/log/ldap

For syslog-ng, add or modify the following line in syslog-ng.conf:

       options { sync(n); };

where n is the number of lines which will be buffered before a write.
21.4. Caching

We all know what caching is, don't we?

In brief, "A cache is a block of memory for temporary storage of data likely to be used again" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache

There are 3 types of caches, BerkeleyDB's own cache, slapd(8) entry cache and IDL (IDL) cache.
21.4.1. Berkeley DB Cache

There are two ways to tune for the BDB cachesize:

(a) BDB cache size necessary to load the database via slapadd in optimal time

(b) BDB cache size necessary to have a high performing running slapd once the data is loaded

For (a), the optimal cachesize is the size of the entire database. If you already have the database loaded, this is simply a

       du -c -h *.bdb

in the directory containing the OpenLDAP (/usr/local/var/openldap-data) data.

For (b), the optimal cachesize is just the size of the id2entry.bdb file, plus about 10% for growth.

The tuning of DB_CONFIG should be done for each BDB type database instantiated (back-bdb, back-hdb).

Note that while the BDB cache is just raw chunks of memory and configured as a memory size, the slapd(8) entry cache holds parsed entries, and the size of each entry is variable.

There is also an IDL cache which is used for Index Data Lookups. If you can fit all of your database into slapd's entry cache, and all of your index lookups fit in the IDL cache, that will provide the maximum throughput.

If not, but you can fit the entire database into the BDB cache, then you should do that and shrink the slapd entry cache as appropriate.

Failing that, you should balance the BDB cache against the entry cache.

It is worth noting that it is not absolutely necessary to configure a BerkeleyDB cache equal in size to your entire database. All that you need is a cache that's large enough for your "working set."

That means, large enough to hold all of the most frequently accessed data, plus a few less-frequently accessed items.

For more information, please see: http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/ref/am_conf/cachesize.html
21.4.1.1. Calculating Cachesize

The back-bdb database lives in two main files, dn2id.bdb and id2entry.bdb. These are B-tree databases. We have never documented the back-bdb internal layout before, because it didn't seem like something anyone should have to worry about, nor was it necessarily cast in stone. But here's how it works today, in OpenLDAP 2.4.

A B-tree is a balanced tree; it stores data in its leaf nodes and bookkeeping data in its interior nodes (If you don't know what tree data structures look like in general, Google for some references, because that's getting far too elementary for the purposes of this discussion).

For decent performance, you need enough cache memory to contain all the nodes along the path from the root of the tree down to the particular data item you're accessing. That's enough cache for a single search. For the general case, you want enough cache to contain all the internal nodes in the database.

       db_stat -d

will tell you how many internal pages are present in a database. You should check this number for both dn2id and id2entry.

Also note that id2entry always uses 16KB per "page", while dn2id uses whatever the underlying filesystem uses, typically 4 or 8KB. To avoid thrashing, your cache must be at least as large as the number of internal pages in both the dn2id and id2entry databases, plus some extra space to accommodate the actual leaf data pages.

For example, in my OpenLDAP 2.4 test database, I have an input LDIF file that's about 360MB. With the back-hdb backend this creates a dn2id.bdb that's 68MB, and an id2entry that's 800MB. db_stat tells me that dn2id uses 4KB pages, has 433 internal pages, and 6378 leaf pages. The id2entry uses 16KB pages, has 52 internal pages, and 45912 leaf pages. In order to efficiently retrieve any single entry in this database, the cache should be at least

       (433+1) * 4KB + (52+1) * 16KB in size: 1736KB + 848KB =~ 2.5MB.

This doesn't take into account other library overhead, so this is even lower than the barest minimum. The default cache size, when nothing is configured, is only 256KB.

This 2.5MB number also doesn't take indexing into account. Each indexed attribute results in another database file. Earlier versions of OpenLDAP kept these index databases in Hash format, but from OpenLDAP 2.2 onward the index databases are in B-tree format so the same procedure can be used to calculate the necessary amount of cache for each index database.

For example, if your only index is for the objectClass attribute and db_stat reveals that objectClass.bdb has 339 internal pages and uses 4096 byte pages, the additional cache needed for just this attribute index is

       (339+1) * 4KB =~ 1.3MB.

With only this index enabled, I'd figure at least a 4MB cache for this backend. (Of course you're using a single cache shared among all of the database files, so the cache pages will most likely get used for something other than what you accounted for, but this gives you a fighting chance.)

With this 4MB cache I can slapcat this entire database on my 1.3GHz PIII in 1 minute, 40 seconds. With the cache doubled to 8MB, it still takes the same 1:40s. Once you've got enough cache to fit the B-tree internal pages, increasing it further won't have any effect until the cache really is large enough to hold 100% of the data pages. I don't have enough free RAM to hold all the 800MB id2entry data, so 4MB is good enough.

With back-bdb and back-hdb you can use "db_stat -m" to check how well the database cache is performing.

For more information on db_stat: http://www.oracle.com/technology/documentation/berkeley-db/db/utility/db_stat.html
21.4.2. slapd(8) Entry Cache (cachesize)

The slapd(8) entry cache operates on decoded entries. The rationale - entries in the entry cache can be used directly, giving the fastest response. If an entry isn't in the entry cache but can be extracted from the BDB page cache, that will avoid an I/O but it will still require parsing, so this will be slower.

If the entry is in neither cache then BDB will have to flush some of its current cached pages and bring in the needed pages, resulting in a couple of expensive I/Os as well as parsing.

The most optimal value is of course, the entire number of entries in the database. However, most directory servers don't consistently serve out their entire database, so setting this to a lesser number that more closely matches the believed working set of data is sufficient. This is the second most important parameter for the DB.

As far as balancing the entry cache vs the BDB cache - parsed entries in memory are generally about twice as large as they are on disk.

As we have already mentioned, not having a proper database cache size will cause performance issues. These issues are not an indication of corruption occurring in the database. It is merely the fact that the cache is thrashing itself that causes performance/response time to slowdown.
21.4.3. IDL Cache (idlcachesize)

Each IDL holds the search results from a given query, so the IDL cache will end up holding the most frequently requested search results. For back-bdb, it is generally recommended to match the "cachesize" setting. For back-hdb, it is generally recommended to be 3x"cachesize".

{NOTE: The idlcachesize setting directly affects search performance}
21.5. slapd(8) Threads

slapd(8) can process requests via a configurable number of threads, which in turn affects the in/out rate of connections.

This value should generally be a function of the number of "real" cores on the system, for example on a server with 2 CPUs with one core each, set this to 8, or 4 threads per real core. This is a "read" maximized value. The more threads that are configured per core, the slower slapd(8) responds for "read" operations. On the flip side, it appears to handle write operations faster in a heavy write/low read scenario.

The upper bound for good read performance appears to be 16 threads (which also happens to be the default setting).

A. Changes Since Previous Release

The following sections attempt to summarize the new features and changes in OpenLDAP software since the 2.3.x release and the OpenLDAP Admin Guide.
A.1. New Guide Sections

In order to make the Admin Guide more thorough and cover the majority of questions asked on the OpenLDAP mailing lists and scenarios discussed there, we have added the following new sections:

    When should I use LDAP?
    When should I not use LDAP?
    LDAP vs RDBMS
    Access Control
    Backends
    Overlays
    Replication
    Maintenance

    LDAP Result Codes
    Glossary

Also, the table of contents is now 3 levels deep to ease navigation.
A.2. New Features and Enhancements in 2.4
A.2.1. Better cn=config functionality

There is a new slapd-config(5) manpage for the cn=config backend. The original design called for auto-renaming of config entries when you insert or delete entries with ordered names, but that was not implemented in 2.3. It is now in 2.4. This means, e.g., if you have

   olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
   olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com

and you want to add a new subordinate, now you can ldapadd:

   olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
   olcSuffix: dc=foo,dc=example,dc=com

This will insert a new BDB database in slot 1 and bump all following databases down one, so the original BDB database will now be named:

   olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config
   olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com

A.2.2. Better cn=schema functionality

In 2.3 you were only able to add new schema elements, not delete or modify existing elements. In 2.4 you can modify schema at will. (Except for the hardcoded system schema, of course.)
A.2.3. More sophisticated Syncrepl configurations

The original implementation of Syncrepl in OpenLDAP 2.2 was intended to support multiple consumers within the same database, but that feature never worked and was removed from OpenLDAP 2.3; you could only configure a single consumer in any database.

In 2.4 you can configure multiple consumers in a single database. The configuration possibilities here are quite complex and numerous. You can configure consumers over arbitrary subtrees of a database (disjoint or overlapping). Any portion of the database may in turn be provided to other consumers using the Syncprov overlay. The Syncprov overlay works with any number of consumers over a single database or over arbitrarily many glued databases.
A.2.4. N-Way Multimaster Replication

As a consequence of the work to support multiple consumer contexts, the syncrepl system now supports full N-Way multimaster replication with entry-level conflict resolution. There are some important constraints, of course: In order to maintain consistent results across all servers, you must maintain tightly synchronized clocks across all participating servers (e.g., you must use NTP on all servers).

The entryCSNs used for replication now record timestamps with microsecond resolution, instead of just seconds. The delta-syncrepl code has not been updated to support multimaster usage yet, that will come later in the 2.4 cycle.
A.2.5. Replicating slapd Configuration (syncrepl and cn=config)

Syncrepl was explicitly disabled on cn=config in 2.3. It is now fully supported in 2.4; you can use syncrepl to replicate an entire server configuration from one server to arbitrarily many other servers. It's possible to clone an entire running slapd using just a small (less than 10 lines) seed configuration, or you can just replicate the schema subtrees, etc. Tests 049 and 050 in the test suite provide working examples of these capabilities.
A.2.6. Push-Mode Replication

In 2.3 you could configure syncrepl as a full push-mode replicator by using it in conjunction with a back-ldap pointed at the target server. But because the back-ldap database needs to have a suffix corresponding to the target's suffix, you could only configure one instance per slapd.

In 2.4 you can define a database to be "hidden", which means that its suffix is ignored when checking for name collisions, and the database will never be used to answer requests received by the frontend. Using this "hidden" database feature allows you to configure multiple databases with the same suffix, allowing you to set up multiple back-ldap instances for pushing replication of a single database to multiple targets. There may be other uses for hidden databases as well (e.g., using a syncrepl consumer to maintain a *local* mirror of a database on a separate filesystem).
A.2.7. More extensive TLS configuration control

In 2.3, the TLS configuration in slapd was only used by the slapd listeners. For outbound connections used by e.g. back-ldap or syncrepl their TLS parameters came from the system's ldap.conf file.

In 2.4 all of these sessions inherit their settings from the main slapd configuration, but settings can be individually overridden on a per-config-item basis. This is particularly helpful if you use certificate-based authentication and need to use a different client certificate for different destinations.
A.2.8. Performance enhancements

Too many to list. Some notable changes - ldapadd used to be a couple of orders of magnitude slower than "slapadd -q". It's now at worst only about half the speed of slapadd -q. Some comparisons of all the 2.x OpenLDAP releases are available at http://www.openldap.org/pub/hyc/scale2007.pdf

That compared 2.0.27, 2.1.30, 2.2.30, 2.3.33, and CVS HEAD). Toward the latter end of the "Cached Search Performance" chart it gets hard to see the difference because the run times are so small, but the new code is about 25% faster than 2.3, which was about 20% faster than 2.2, which was about 100% faster than 2.1, which was about 100% faster than 2.0, in that particular search scenario. That test basically searched a 1.3GB DB of 380836 entries (all in the slapd entry cache) in under 1 second. i.e., on a 2.4GHz CPU with DDR400 ECC/Registered RAM we can search over 500 thousand entries per second. The search was on an unindexed attribute using a filter that would not match any entry, forcing slapd to examine every entry in the DB, testing the filter for a match.

Essentially the slapd entry cache in back-bdb/back-hdb is so efficient the search processing time is almost invisible; the runtime is limited only by the memory bandwidth of the machine. (The search data rate corresponds to about 3.5GB/sec; the memory bandwidth on the machine is only about 4GB/sec due to ECC and register latency.)
A.2.9. New overlays

    slapo-constraint (Attribute value constraints)
    slapo-dds (Dynamic Directory Services, RFC 2589)
    slapo-memberof (reverse group membership maintenance)

A.2.10. New features in existing Overlays

    slapo-pcache
        Inspection/Maintenance
            the cache database can be directly accessed via LDAP by adding a specific control to each LDAP request; a specific extended operation allows to consistently remove cached entries and entire cached queries
        Hot Restart
            cached queries are saved on disk at shutdown, and reloaded if not expired yet at subsequent restart
    slapo-rwm can safely interoperate with other overlays
    Dyngroup/Dynlist merge, plus security enhancements
        added dgIdentity support (draft-haripriya-dynamicgroup)

A.2.11. New features in slapd

    monitoring of back-{b,h}db: cache fill-in, non-indexed searches,
    session tracking control (draft-wahl-ldap-session)
    subtree delete in back-sql (draft-armijo-ldap-treedelete)
    sorted values in multivalued attributes for faster matching
    lightweight dispatcher for greater throughput under heavy load and on multiprocessor machines. (33% faster than 2.3 on AMD quad-socket dual-core server.)

A.2.12. New features in libldap

    ldap_sync client API (LDAP Content Sync Operation, RFC 4533)

A.2.13. New clients, tools and tool enhancements

    ldapexop for arbitrary extended operations
    Complete support of controls in request/response for all clients
    LDAP Client tools now honor SRV records

A.2.14. New build options

    Support for building against GnuTLS

A.3. Obsolete Features Removed From 2.4

These features were strongly deprecated in 2.3 and removed in 2.4.
A.3.1. Slurpd

Please read the Replication section as to why this is no longer in OpenLDAP
A.3.2. back-ldbm

back-ldbm was both slow and unreliable. Its byzantine indexing code was prone to spontaneous corruption, as were the underlying database libraries that were commonly used (e.g. GDBM or NDBM). back-bdb and back-hdb are superior in every aspect, with simplified indexing to avoid index corruption, fine-grained locking for greater concurrency, hierarchical caching for greater performance, streamlined on-disk format for greater efficiency and portability, and full transaction support for greater reliability.

B. Upgrading from 2.3.x

The following sections attempt to document the steps you will need to take in order to upgrade from the latest 2.3.x OpenLDAP version.

The normal upgrade procedure, as discussed in the Maintenance section, should of course still be followed prior to doing any of this.
B.1. cn=config olc* attributes

Quite a few olc* attributes have now become obsolete, if you see in your logs entries like below, just remove them from the relevant ldif file.

           olcReplicationInterval: value #0: <olcReplicationInterval> keyword is obsolete (ignored)

B.2. ACLs: searches require privileges on the search base

Search operations now require "search" privileges on the "entry" pseudo-attribute of the search base. While upgrading from 2.3.x, make sure your ACLs grant such privileges to all desired search bases.

For example, assuming you have the following ACL:

           access to dn.sub="ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" by * search

Searches using a base of "dc=example,dc=com" will only be allowed if you add the following ACL:

           access to dn.base="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=entry by * search

Note: The slapd.access(5) man page states that this requirement was introduced with OpenLDAP 2.3. However, it is the default behavior only since 2.4.

C. Common errors encountered when using OpenLDAP Software

The following sections attempt to summarize the most common causes of LDAP errors when using OpenLDAP
C.1. Common causes of LDAP errors
C.1.1. ldap_*: Can't contact LDAP server

The Can't contact LDAP server error is usually returned when the LDAP server cannot be contacted. This may occur for many reasons:

    the LDAP server is not running; this can be checked by running, for example,
    
      telnet <host> <port>

replacing <host> and <port> with the hostname and the port the server is supposed to listen on.

    the client has not been instructed to contact a running server; with OpenLDAP command-line tools this is accomplished by providing the -H switch, whose argument is a valid LDAP url corresponding to the interface the server is supposed to be listening on.

C.1.2. ldap_*: No such object

The no such object error is generally returned when the target DN of the operation cannot be located. This section details reasons common to all operations. You should also look for answers specific to the operation (as indicated in the error message).

The most common reason for this error is non-existence of the named object. First, check for typos.

Also note that, by default, a new directory server holds no objects (except for a few system entries). So, if you are setting up a new directory server and get this message, it may simply be that you have yet to add the object you are trying to locate.

The error commonly occurs because a DN was not specified and a default was not properly configured.

If you have a suffix specified in slapd.conf eg.

      suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

You should use

      ldapsearch -b 'dc=example,dc=com' '(cn=jane*)'

to tell it where to start the search.

The -b should be specified for all LDAP commands unless you have an ldap.conf(5) default configured.

See ldapsearch(1), ldapmodify(1)

Also, slapadd(8) and its ancillary programs are very strict about the syntax of the LDIF file.

Some liberties in the LDIF file may result in an apparently successful creation of the database, but accessing some parts of it may be difficult.

One known common error in database creation is putting a blank line before the first entry in the LDIF file. There must be no leading blank lines in the LDIF file.

It is generally recommended that ldapadd(1) be used instead of slapadd(8) when adding new entries your directory. slapadd(8) should be used to bulk load entries known to be valid.

Another cause of this message is a referral ({SECT:Constructing a Distributed Directory Service}}) entry to an unpopulated directory.

Either remove the referral, or add a single record with the referral base DN to the empty directory.

This error may also occur when slapd is unable to access the contents of its database because of file permission problems. For instance, on a Red Hat Linux system, slapd runs as user 'ldap'. When slapadd is run as root to create a database from scratch, the contents of /var/lib/ldap are created with user and group root and with permission 600, making the contents inaccessible to the slapd server.
C.1.3. ldap_*: Can't chase referral

This is caused by the line

      referral        ldap://root.openldap.org

In slapd.conf, it was provided as an example for how to use referrals in the original file. However if your machine is not permanently connected to the Internet, it will fail to find the server, and hence produce an error message.

To resolve, just place a # in front of line and restart slapd or point it to an available ldap server.

See also: ldapadd(1), ldapmodify(1) and slapd.conf(5)
C.1.4. ldap_*: server is unwilling to perform

slapd will return an unwilling to perform error if the backend holding the target entry does not support the given operation.

The password backend is only willing to perform searches. It will return an unwilling to perform error for all other operations.

The shell backend is configurable and may support a limited subset of operations. Check for other errors indicating a shortage of resources required by the directory server. i.e. you may have a full disk etc
C.1.5. ldap_*: Insufficient access

This error occurs when server denies the operation due to insufficient access. This is usually caused by binding to a DN with insufficient privileges (or binding anonymously) to perform the operation.

You can bind as the rootdn/rootpw specified in slapd.conf(5) to gain full access. Otherwise, you must bind to an entry which has been granted the appropriate rights through access controls.
C.1.6. ldap_*: Invalid DN syntax

The target (or other) DN of the operation is invalid. This implies that either the string representation of the DN is not in the required form, one of the types in the attribute value assertions is not defined, or one of the values in the attribute value assertions does not conform to the appropriate syntax.
C.1.7. ldap_*: Referral hop limit exceeded

This error generally occurs when the client chases a referral which refers itself back to a server it already contacted. The server responds as it did before and the client loops. This loop is detected when the hop limit is exceeded.

This is most often caused through misconfiguration of the server's default referral. The default referral should not be itself:

That is, on ldap://myldap/ the default referral should not be ldap://myldap/ (or any hostname/ip which is equivalent to myldap).
C.1.8. ldap_*: operations error

In some versions of slapd(8), operationsError was returned instead of other.
C.1.9. ldap_*: other error

The other result code indicates an internal error has occurred. While the additional information provided with the result code might provide some hint as to the problem, often one will need to consult the server's log files.
C.1.10. ldap_add/modify: Invalid syntax

This error is reported when a value of an attribute does not conform to syntax restrictions. Additional information is commonly provided stating which value of which attribute was found to be invalid. Double check this value and other values (the server will only report the first error it finds).

Common causes include:

    extraneous whitespace (especially trailing whitespace)
    improperly encoded characters (LDAPv3 uses UTF-8 encoded Unicode)
    empty values (few syntaxes allow empty values)

For certain syntax, like OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID), this error can indicate that the OID descriptor (a "short name") provided is unrecognized. For instance, this error is returned if the objectClass value provided is unrecognized.
C.1.11. ldap_add/modify: Object class violation

This error is returned with the entry to be added or the entry as modified violates the object class schema rules. Normally additional information is returned the error detailing the violation. Some of these are detailed below.

Violations related to the entry's attributes:

      Attribute not allowed

A provided attribute is not allowed by the entry's object class(es).

      Missing required attribute

An attribute required by the entry's object class(es) was not provided.

Violations related to the entry's class(es):

      Entry has no objectClass attribute

The entry did not state which object classes it belonged to.

      Unrecognized objectClass

One (or more) of the listed objectClass values is not recognized.

      No structural object class provided

None of the listed objectClass values is structural.

      Invalid structural object class chain

Two or more structural objectClass values are not in same structural object class chain.

      Structural object class modification

Modify operation attempts to change the structural class of the entry.

      Instanstantiation of abstract objectClass.

An abstract class is not subordinate to any listed structural or auxiliary class.

      Invalid structural object class

Other structural object class problem.

      No structuralObjectClass operational attribute

This is commonly returned when a shadow server is provided an entry which does not contain the structuralObjectClass operational attribute.

Note that the above error messages as well as the above answer assumes basic knowledge of LDAP/X.500 schema.
C.1.12. ldap_add: No such object

The "ldap_add: No such object" error is commonly returned if parent of the entry being added does not exist. Add the parent entry first...

For example, if you are adding "cn=bob,dc=domain,dc=com" and you get:

      ldap_add: No such object

The entry "dc=domain,dc=com" likely doesn't exist. You can use ldapsearch to see if does exist:

      ldapsearch -b 'dc=domain,dc=com' -s base '(objectclass=*)'

If it doesn't, add it. See A Quick-Start Guide for assistance.

Note: if the entry being added is the same as database suffix, it's parent isn't required. i.e.: if your suffix is "dc=domain,dc=com", "dc=com" doesn't need to exist to add "dc=domain,dc=com".

This error will also occur if you try to add any entry that the server is not configured to hold.

For example, if your database suffix is "dc=domain,dc=com" and you attempt to add "dc=domain2,dc=com", "dc=com", "dc=domain,dc=org", "o=domain,c=us", or an other DN in the "dc=domain,dc=com" subtree, the server will return a "No such object" (or referral) error.

slapd(8) will generally return "no global superior knowledge" as additional information indicating its return noSuchObject instead of a referral as the server is not configured with knowledge of a global superior server.
C.1.13. ldap add: invalid structural object class chain

This particular error refers to the rule about STRUCTURAL objectclasses, which states that an object is of one STRUCTURAL class, the structural class of the object. The object is said to belong to this class, zero or more auxiliaries classes, and their super classes.

While all of these classes are commonly listed in the objectClass attribute of the entry, one of these classes is the structural object class of the entry. Thus, it is OK for an objectClass attribute to contain inetOrgPerson, organizationalPerson, and person because they inherit one from another to form a single super class chain. That is, inetOrgPerson SUPs organizationPerson SUPs person. On the other hand, it is invalid for both inetOrgPerson and account to be listed in objectClass as inetOrgPerson and account are not part of the same super class chain (unless some other class is also listed with is a subclass of both).

To resolve this problem, one must determine which class will better serve structural object class for the entry, adding this class to the objectClass attribute (if not already present), and remove any other structural class from the entry's objectClass attribute which is not a super class of the structural object class.

Which object class is better depends on the particulars of the situation. One generally should consult the documentation for the applications one is using for help in making the determination.
C.1.14. ldap_add: no structuralObjectClass operational attribute

ldapadd(1) may error:

      adding new entry "uid=XXX,ou=People,o=campus,c=ru"
        ldap_add: Internal (implementation specific) error (80)
           additional info: no structuralObjectClass operational attribute

when slapd(8) cannot determine, based upon the contents of the objectClass attribute, what the structural class of the object should be.
C.1.15. ldap_add/modify/rename: Naming violation

OpenLDAP's slapd checks for naming attributes and distinguished values consistency, according to RFC 4512.

Naming attributes are those attributeTypes that appear in an entry's RDN; distinguished values are the values of the naming attributes that appear in an entry's RDN, e.g, in

      cn=Someone+mail=someone@example.com,dc=example,dc=com

the naming attributes are cn and mail, and the distinguished values are Someone and someone@example.com.

OpenLDAP's slapd checks for consistency when:

    adding an entry
    modifying an entry, if the values of the naming attributes are changed
    renaming an entry, if the RDN of the entry changes

Possible causes of error are:

    the naming attributes are not present in the entry; for example:
    
                dn: dc=example,dc=com
                objectClass: organization
                o: Example
                # note: "dc: example" is missing
    
    the naming attributes are present in the entry, but in the attributeType definition they are marked as:
        collective
        operational
        obsolete
    the naming attributes are present in the entry, but the distinguished values are not; for example:
    
                dn: dc=example,dc=com
                objectClass: domain
                dc: foobar
                # note: "dc" is present, but the value is not "example"
    
    the naming attributes are present in the entry, with the distinguished values, but the naming attributes:
        do not have an equality field, so equality cannot be asserted
        the matching rule is not supported (yet)
        the matching rule is not appropriate
    the given distinguished values do not comply with their syntax
    other errors occurred during the validation/normalization/match process; this is a catchall: look at previous logs for details in case none of the above apply to your case.

In any case, make sure that the attributeType definition for the naming attributes contains an appropriate EQUALITY field; or that of the superior, if they are defined based on a superior attributeType (look at the SUP field). See RFC 4512 for details.
C.1.16. ldap_add/delete/modify/rename: no global superior knowledge

If the target entry name places is not within any of the databases the server is configured to hold and the server has no knowledge of a global superior, the server will indicate it is unwilling to perform the operation and provide the text "no global superior knowledge" as additional text.

Likely the entry name is incorrect, or the server is not properly configured to hold the named entry, or, in distributed directory environments, a default referral was not configured.
C.1.17. ldap_bind: Insufficient access

Current versions of slapd(8) requires that clients have authentication permission to attribute types used for authentication purposes before accessing them to perform the bind operation. As all bind operations are done anonymously (regardless of previous bind success), the auth access must be granted to anonymous.

In the example ACL below grants the following access:

    to anonymous users:
        permission to authenticate using values of userPassword
    to authenticated users:
        permission to update (but not read) their userPassword
        permission to read any object excepting values of userPassword

All other access is denied.

        access to attr=userPassword
          by self =w
          by anonymous auth
        access *
          by self write
          by users read

C.1.18. ldap_bind: Invalid credentials

The error usually occurs when the credentials (password) provided does not match the userPassword held in entry you are binding to.

The error can also occur when the bind DN specified is not known to the server.

Check both! In addition to the cases mentioned above you should check if the server denied access to userPassword on selected parts of the directory. In fact, slapd always returns "Invalid credentials" in case of failed bind, regardless of the failure reason, since other return codes could reveal the validity of the user's name.

To debug access rules defined in slapd.conf, add "ACL" to log level.
C.1.19. ldap_bind: Protocol error

There error is generally occurs when the LDAP version requested by the client is not supported by the server.

The OpenLDAP Software 2.x server, by default, only accepts version 3 LDAP Bind requests but can be configured to accept a version 2 LDAP Bind request.

Note: The 2.x server expects LDAPv3 [RFC4510] to be used when the client requests version 3 and expects a limited LDAPv3 variant (basically, LDAPv3 syntax and semantics in an LDAPv2 PDUs) to be used when version 2 is expected.

This variant is also sometimes referred to as LDAPv2+, but differs from the U-Mich LDAP variant in a number of ways.
C.1.20. ldap_modify: cannot modify object class

This message is commonly returned when attempting to modify the objectClass attribute in a manner inconsistent with the LDAP/X.500 information model. In particular, it commonly occurs when one tries to change the structure of the object from one class to another, for instance, trying to change an 'apple' into a 'pear' or a 'fruit' into a 'pear'.

Such changes are disallowed by the slapd(8) in accordance with LDAP and X.500 restrictions.
C.1.21. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: ...

If you intended to bind using a DN and password and get an error from ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s, you likely forgot to provide a '-x' option to the command. By default, SASL authentication is used. '-x' is necessary to select "simple" authentication.
C.1.22. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: No such Object

This indicates that LDAP SASL authentication function could not read the Root DSE. The error will occur when the server doesn't provide a root DSE. This may be due to access controls.
C.1.23. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: No such attribute

This indicates that LDAP SASL authentication function could read the Root DSE but it contained no supportedSASLMechanism attribute.

The supportedSASLmechanism attribute lists mechanisms currently available. The list may be empty because none of the supported mechanisms are currently available. For example, EXTERNAL is listed only if the client has established its identity by authenticating at a lower level (e.g. TLS).

Note: the attribute may not be visible due to access controls

Note: SASL bind is the default for all OpenLDAP tools, e.g. ldapsearch(1), ldapmodify(1). To force use of "simple" bind, use the "-x" option. Use of "simple" bind is not recommended unless one has adequate confidentiality protection in place (e.g. TLS/SSL, IPSEC).

C.1.24. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Unknown authentication method

This indicates that none of the SASL authentication supported by the server are supported by the client, or that they are too weak or otherwise inappropriate for use by the client. Note that the default security options disallows the use of certain mechanisms such as ANONYMOUS and PLAIN (without TLS).

Note: SASL bind is the default for all OpenLDAP tools. To force use of "simple" bind, use the "-x" option. Use of "simple" bind is not recommended unless one has adequate confidentiality protection in place (e.g. TLS/SSL, IPSEC).

C.1.25. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error (82)

Apparently not having forward and reverse DNS entries for the LDAP server can result in this error.
C.1.26. ldap_search: Partial results and referral received

This error is returned with the server responses to an LDAPv2 search query with both results (zero or more matched entries) and references (referrals to other servers). See also: ldapsearch(1).

If the updatedn on the replica does not exist, a referral will be returned. It may do this as well if the ACL needs tweaking.
C.1.27. ldap_start_tls: Operations error

ldapsearch(1) and other tools will return

        ldap_start_tls: Operations error (1)
              additional info: TLS already started

When the user (though command line options and/or ldap.conf(5)) has requested TLS (SSL) be started twice. For instance, when specifying both "-H ldaps://server.do.main" and "-ZZ".
C.2. Other Errors
C.2.1. ber_get_next on fd X failed errno=34 (Numerical result out of range)

This slapd error generally indicates that the client sent a message that exceeded an administrative limit. See sockbuf_max_incoming and sockbuf_max_incoming_auth configuration directives in slapd.conf(5).
C.2.2. ber_get_next on fd X failed errno=11 (Resource temporarily unavailable)

This message is not indicative of abnormal behavior or error. It simply means that expected data is not yet available from the resource, in this context, a network socket. slapd(8) will process the data once it does becomes available.
C.2.3. daemon: socket() failed errno=97 (Address family not supported)

This message indicates that the operating system does not support one of the (protocol) address families which slapd(8) was configured to support. Most commonly, this occurs when slapd(8) was configured to support IPv6 yet the operating system kernel wasn't. In such cases, the message can be ignored.
C.2.4. GSSAPI: gss_acquire_cred: Miscellaneous failure; Permission denied;

This message means that slapd is not running as root and, thus, it cannot get its Kerberos 5 key from the keytab, usually file /etc/krb5.keytab.

A keytab file is used to store keys that are to be used by services or daemons that are started at boot time. It is very important that these secrets are kept beyond reach of intruders.

That's why the default keytab file is owned by root and protected from being read by others. Do not mess with these permissions, build a different keytab file for slapd instead, and make sure it is owned by the user that slapd runs as.

To do this, start kadmin, and enter the following commands:

     addprinc -randkey ldap/ldap.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
     ktadd -k /etc/openldap/ldap.keytab ldap/ldap.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

Then, on the shell, do:

     chown ldap:ldap /etc/openldap/ldap.keytab
     chmod 600 /etc/openldap/ldap.keytab

Now you have to tell slapd (well, actually tell the gssapi library in Kerberos 5 that is invoked by Cyrus SASL) where to find the new keytab. You do this by setting the environment variable KRB5_KTNAME like this:

     export KRB5_KTNAME="FILE:/etc/openldap/ldap.keytab"

Set that environment variable on the slapd start script (Red Hat users might find /etc/sysconfig/ldap a perfect place).

This only works if you are using MIT kerberos. It doesn't work with Heimdal, for instance.

In Heimdal there is a function gsskrb5_register_acceptor_identity() that sets the path of the keytab file you want to use. In Cyrus SASL 2 you can add

    keytab: /path/to/file

to your application's SASL config file to use this feature. This only works with Heimdal.
C.2.5. access from unknown denied

This related to TCP wrappers. See hosts_access(5) for more information. in the log file: "access from unknown denied" This related to TCP wrappers. See hosts_access(5) for more information. for example: add the line "slapd: .hosts.you.want.to.allow" in /etc/hosts.allow to get rid of the error.
C.2.6. ldap_read: want=# error=Resource temporarily unavailable

This message occurs normally. It means that pending data is not yet available from the resource, a network socket. slapd(8) will process the data once it becomes available.
C.2.7. `make test' fails

Some times, `make test' fails at the very first test with an obscure message like

    make test
    make[1]: Entering directory `/ldap_files/openldap-2.4.6/tests'

or so. Usually, the five lines

Waiting 5 seconds for slapd to start...

indicate that slapd didn't start at all.

In tests/testrun/slapd.1.log there is a full log of what slapd wrote while trying to start. The log level can be increased by setting the environment variable SLAPD_DEBUG to the corresponding value; see loglevel in slapd.conf(5) for the meaning of log levels.

A typical reason for this behavior is a runtime link problem, i.e. slapd cannot find some dynamic libraries it was linked against. Try running ldd(1) on slapd (for those architectures that support runtime linking).

There might well be other reasons; the contents of the log file should help clarifying them.

Tests that fire up multiple instances of slapd typically log to tests/testrun/slapd.<n>.log, with a distinct <n> for each instance of slapd; list tests/testrun/ for possible values of <n>.
C.2.8. ldap_*: Internal (implementation specific) error (80) - additional info: entry index delete failed

This seems to be related with wrong ownership of the BDB's dir (/var/lib/ldap) and files. The files must be owned by the user that slapd runs as.

    chown -R ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap

fixes it in Debian
C.2.9. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1)

Using SASL, when a client contacts LDAP server, the slapd service dies immediately and client gets an error :

     SASL/GSSAPI authentication started ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1)

Then check the slapd service, it stopped.

This may come from incompatible of using different versions of BerkeleyDB for installing of SASL and installing of OpenLDAP. The problem arises in case of using multiple version of BerkeleyDB. Solution: - Check which version of BerkeleyDB when install Cyrus SASL.

Reinstall OpenLDAP with the version of BerkeleyDB above.

H. LDAP Result Codes

For the purposes of this guide, we have incorporated the standard LDAP result codes from Appendix A. LDAP Result Codes of RFC4511, a copy of which can be found in doc/rfc of the OpenLDAP source code.

We have expanded the description of each error in relation to the OpenLDAP toolsets. LDAP extensions may introduce extension-specific result codes, which are not part of RFC4511. OpenLDAP returns the result codes related to extensions it implements. Their meaning is documented in the extension they are related to.
H.1. Non-Error Result Codes

These result codes (called "non-error" result codes) do not indicate an error condition:

        success (0),
        compareFalse (5),
        compareTrue (6),
        referral (10), and
        saslBindInProgress (14).

The success, compareTrue, and compareFalse result codes indicate successful completion (and, hence, are referred to as "successful" result codes).

The referral and saslBindInProgress result codes indicate the client needs to take additional action to complete the operation.
H.2. Result Codes

Existing LDAP result codes are described as follows:
H.3. success (0)

Indicates the successful completion of an operation.

Note: this code is not used with the Compare operation. See compareFalse (5) and compareTrue (6).

H.4. operationsError (1)

Indicates that the operation is not properly sequenced with relation to other operations (of same or different type).

For example, this code is returned if the client attempts to StartTLS (RFC4511 Section 4.14) while there are other uncompleted operations or if a TLS layer was already installed.
H.5. protocolError (2)

Indicates the server received data that is not well-formed.

For Bind operation only, this code is also used to indicate that the server does not support the requested protocol version.

For Extended operations only, this code is also used to indicate that the server does not support (by design or configuration) the Extended operation associated with the requestName.

For request operations specifying multiple controls, this may be used to indicate that the server cannot ignore the order of the controls as specified, or that the combination of the specified controls is invalid or unspecified.
H.6. timeLimitExceeded (3)

Indicates that the time limit specified by the client was exceeded before the operation could be completed.
H.7. sizeLimitExceeded (4)

Indicates that the size limit specified by the client was exceeded before the operation could be completed.
H.8. compareFalse (5)

Indicates that the Compare operation has successfully completed and the assertion has evaluated to FALSE or Undefined.
H.9. compareTrue (6)

Indicates that the Compare operation has successfully completed and the assertion has evaluated to TRUE.
H.10. authMethodNotSupported (7)

Indicates that the authentication method or mechanism is not supported.
H.11. strongerAuthRequired (8)

Indicates the server requires strong(er) authentication in order to complete the operation.

When used with the Notice of Disconnection operation, this code indicates that the server has detected that an established security association between the client and server has unexpectedly failed or been compromised.
H.12. referral (10)

Indicates that a referral needs to be chased to complete the operation (see RFC4511 Section 4.1.10).
H.13. adminLimitExceeded (11)

Indicates that an administrative limit has been exceeded.
H.14. unavailableCriticalExtension (12)

Indicates a critical control is unrecognized (see RFC4511 Section 4.1.11).
H.15. confidentialityRequired (13)

Indicates that data confidentiality protections are required.
H.16. saslBindInProgress (14)

Indicates the server requires the client to send a new bind request, with the same SASL mechanism, to continue the authentication process (see RFC4511 Section 4.2).
H.17. noSuchAttribute (16)

Indicates that the named entry does not contain the specified attribute or attribute value.
H.18. undefinedAttributeType (17)

Indicates that a request field contains an unrecognized attribute description.
H.19. inappropriateMatching (18)

Indicates that an attempt was made (e.g., in an assertion) to use a matching rule not defined for the attribute type concerned.
H.20. constraintViolation (19)

Indicates that the client supplied an attribute value that does not conform to the constraints placed upon it by the data model.

For example, this code is returned when multiple values are supplied to an attribute that has a SINGLE-VALUE constraint.
H.21. attributeOrValueExists (20)

Indicates that the client supplied an attribute or value to be added to an entry, but the attribute or value already exists.
H.22. invalidAttributeSyntax (21)

Indicates that a purported attribute value does not conform to the syntax of the attribute.
H.23. noSuchObject (32)

Indicates that the object does not exist in the DIT.
H.24. aliasProblem (33)

Indicates that an alias problem has occurred. For example, the code may used to indicate an alias has been dereferenced that names no object.
H.25. invalidDNSyntax (34)

Indicates that an LDAPDN or RelativeLDAPDN field (e.g., search base, target entry, ModifyDN newrdn, etc.) of a request does not conform to the required syntax or contains attribute values that do not conform to the syntax of the attribute's type.
H.26. aliasDereferencingProblem (36)

Indicates that a problem occurred while dereferencing an alias. Typically, an alias was encountered in a situation where it was not allowed or where access was denied.
H.27. inappropriateAuthentication (48)

Indicates the server requires the client that had attempted to bind anonymously or without supplying credentials to provide some form of credentials.
H.28. invalidCredentials (49)

Indicates that the provided credentials (e.g., the user's name and password) are invalid.
H.29. insufficientAccessRights (50)

Indicates that the client does not have sufficient access rights to perform the operation.
H.30. busy (51)

Indicates that the server is too busy to service the operation.
H.31. unavailable (52)

Indicates that the server is shutting down or a subsystem necessary to complete the operation is offline.
H.32. unwillingToPerform (53)

Indicates that the server is unwilling to perform the operation.
H.33. loopDetect (54)

Indicates that the server has detected an internal loop (e.g., while dereferencing aliases or chaining an operation).
H.34. namingViolation (64)

Indicates that the entry's name violates naming restrictions.
H.35. objectClassViolation (65)

Indicates that the entry violates object class restrictions.
H.36. notAllowedOnNonLeaf (66)

Indicates that the operation is inappropriately acting upon a non-leaf entry.
H.37. notAllowedOnRDN (67)

Indicates that the operation is inappropriately attempting to remove a value that forms the entry's relative distinguished name.
H.38. entryAlreadyExists (68)

Indicates that the request cannot be fulfilled (added, moved, or renamed) as the target entry already exists.
H.39. objectClassModsProhibited (69)

Indicates that an attempt to modify the object class(es) of an entry's 'objectClass' attribute is prohibited.

For example, this code is returned when a client attempts to modify the structural object class of an entry.
H.40. affectsMultipleDSAs (71)

Indicates that the operation cannot be performed as it would affect multiple servers (DSAs).
H.41. other (80)

Indicates the server has encountered an internal error.

J. Generic configure Instructions

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.



# Introduction to OpenLDAP Directory Services

This document describes how to build, configure, and operate [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) Software to provide directory services.  This includes details on how to configure and run the Standalone LDAP Daemon, *slapd*(8).  It is intended for new and experienced administrators alike.  This  section provides a basic introduction to directory services and, in  particular, the directory services provided by *slapd*(8).  This introduction is only intended to provide enough information so one might get started learning about LDAP, X.500, and directory services.

------

## 1.1. What is a directory service?

A directory is a specialized database specifically designed for  searching and browsing, in additional to supporting basic lookup and  update functions.



------

**Note:** A directory is defined by some as merely a database optimized for read access.  This definition, at best, is overly simplistic.

------



Directories tend to contain descriptive, attribute-based information  and support sophisticated filtering capabilities.  Directories generally do not support complicated transaction or roll-back schemes found in  database management systems designed for handling high-volume complex  updates.  Directory updates are typically simple all-or-nothing changes, if they are allowed at all.  Directories are generally tuned to give  quick response to high-volume lookup or search operations. They may have the ability to replicate information widely in order to increase  availability and reliability, while reducing response time.  When  directory information is replicated, temporary inconsistencies between  the consumers may be okay, as long as inconsistencies are resolved in a  timely manner.

There are many different ways to provide a directory service.  Different methods allow different kinds of information to be stored in  the directory, place different requirements on how that information can  be referenced, queried and updated, how it is protected from  unauthorized access, etc.  Some directory services are *local*,  providing service to a restricted context (e.g., the finger service on a single machine). Other services are global, providing service to a much broader context (e.g., the entire Internet).  Global services are  usually *distributed*, meaning that the data they contain is  spread across many machines, all of which cooperate to provide the  directory service. Typically a global service defines a uniform *namespace* which gives the same view of the data no matter where you are in relation to the data itself.

A web directory, such as provided by the *Curlie Project* <https://curlie.org>, is a good example of a directory service. These services catalog web  pages and are specifically designed to support browsing and searching.

While some consider the Internet Domain Name System  (DNS) is an example of a globally distributed directory service, DNS is  not browsable nor searchable.  It is more properly described as a  globally distributed *lookup* service.

------

## 1.2. What is LDAP?

LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  As the name suggests, it is a lightweight protocol for accessing directory services, specifically X.500-based directory services.  LDAP runs over TCP/IP or other connection oriented transfer services.  LDAP is an [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) Standard Track protocol and is specified in "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Technical Specification Road Map" [RFC4510](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4510.txt).

This section gives an overview of LDAP from a user's perspective.

*What kind of information can be stored in the directory?* The LDAP information model is based on *entries*. An entry is a collection of attributes that has a globally-unique Distinguished Name (DN).  The DN is used to refer to the entry unambiguously. Each of the entry's attributes has a *type* and one or more *values*. The types are typically mnemonic strings, like "`cn`" for common name, or "`mail`" for email address. The syntax of values depend on the attribute type.  For example, a `cn` attribute might contain the value `Babs Jensen`.  A `mail` attribute might contain the value "`babs@example.com`". A `jpegPhoto` attribute would contain a photograph in the JPEG (binary) format.

*How is the information arranged?* In LDAP, directory entries  are arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure.  Traditionally, this structure reflected the geographic and/or organizational boundaries.   Entries representing countries appear at the top of the tree. Below them are entries representing states and national organizations. Below them  might be entries representing organizational units, people, printers,  documents, or just about anything else you can think of.  Figure 1.1  shows an example LDAP directory tree using traditional naming.



![img](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/intro_tree.png)



Figure 1.1: LDAP directory tree (traditional naming)

The tree may also be arranged based upon Internet domain names. This  naming approach is becoming increasing popular as it allows for  directory services to be located using the *DNS*. Figure 1.2 shows an example LDAP directory tree using domain-based naming.



![img](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/intro_dctree.png)



Figure 1.2: LDAP directory tree (Internet naming)

In addition, LDAP allows you to control which attributes are required and allowed in an entry through the use of a special attribute called `objectClass`.  The values of the `objectClass` attribute determine the *schema* rules the entry must obey.

*How is the information referenced?* An entry is referenced by its distinguished name, which is constructed by taking the name of the entry itself (called the Relative Distinguished Name or RDN) and concatenating the names of its ancestor entries. For  example, the entry for Barbara Jensen in the Internet naming example  above has an RDN of `uid=babs` and a DN of `uid=babs,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`. The full DN format is described in [RFC4514](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt), "LDAP: String Representation of Distinguished Names."

*How is the information accessed?* LDAP defines operations for interrogating and updating the directory.  Operations are provided for  adding and deleting an entry from the directory, changing an existing  entry, and changing the name of an entry. Most of the time, though, LDAP is used to search for information in the directory. The LDAP search  operation allows some portion of the directory to be searched for  entries that match some criteria specified by a search filter.  Information can be requested from each entry that matches the criteria.

For example, you might want to search the entire directory subtree at and below `dc=example,dc=com` for people with the name `Barbara Jensen`, retrieving the email address of each entry found. LDAP lets you do this easily.  Or you might want to search the entries directly below the `st=California,c=US` entry for organizations with the string `Acme` in their name, and that have a fax number. LDAP lets you do this too.  The next section describes in more detail what you can do with LDAP and  how it might be useful to you.

*How is the information protected from unauthorized access?*  Some directory services provide no protection, allowing anyone to see  the information. LDAP provides a mechanism for a client to authenticate, or prove its identity to a directory server, paving the way for rich  access control to protect the information the server contains. LDAP also supports data security (integrity and confidentiality) services.

------

## 1.3. When should I use LDAP?

This is a very good question. In general, you should use a Directory  server when you require data to be centrally managed, stored and  accessible via standards based methods.

Some common examples found throughout the industry are, but not limited to:

- Machine Authentication
- User Authentication
- User/System Groups
- Address book
- Organization Representation
- Asset Tracking
- Telephony Information Store
- User resource management
- E-mail address lookups
- Application Configuration store
- PBX Configuration store
- etc.....

There are various [Distributed Schema Files](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html#Distributed Schema Files) that are standards based, but you can always create your own [Schema Specification](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html).

There are always new ways to use a Directory and apply LDAP  principles to address certain problems, therefore there is no simple  answer to this question.

If in doubt, join the general LDAP forum for non-commercial discussions and information relating to LDAP at: http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/mailinglist.html and ask

------

## 1.4. When should I not use LDAP?

When you start finding yourself bending the directory to do what you  require, maybe a redesign is needed. Or if you only require one  application to use and manipulate your data (for discussion of LDAP vs  RDBMS, please read the [LDAP vs RDBMS](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/intro.html#LDAP vs RDBMS) section).

It will become obvious when LDAP is the right tool for the job.

------

## 1.5. How does LDAP work?

LDAP utilizes a *client-server model*. One or more LDAP servers contain the data making up the directory information tree (DIT). The client connects to servers and asks it a question.  The server  responds with an answer and/or with a pointer to where the client can  get additional information (typically, another LDAP server). No matter  which LDAP server a client connects to, it sees the same view of the  directory; a name presented to one LDAP server references the same entry it would at another LDAP server.  This is an important feature of a  global directory service.

------

## 1.6. What about X.500?

Technically, LDAP is a directory access protocol to an X.500 directory service, the OSI directory service. Initially, LDAP clients accessed gateways to the  X.500 directory service. This gateway ran LDAP between the client and  gateway and X.500's Directory Access Protocol (DAP) between the gateway and the X.500 server.  DAP is a heavyweight  protocol that operates over a full OSI protocol stack and requires a  significant amount of computing resources.  LDAP is designed to operate  over TCP/IP and provides most of the functionality of DAP at a much lower cost.

While LDAP is still used to access X.500 directory service via  gateways, LDAP is now more commonly directly implemented in X.500  servers.

The Standalone LDAP Daemon, or *slapd*(8), can be viewed as a *lightweight* X.500 directory server.  That is, it does not implement the X.500's DAP nor does it support the complete X.500 models.

If you are already running a X.500 DAP service and you want to  continue to do so, you can probably stop reading this guide.  This guide is all about running LDAP via *slapd*(8), without running X.500  DAP.  If you are not running X.500 DAP, want to stop running X.500 DAP,  or have no immediate plans to run X.500 DAP, read on.

It is possible to replicate data from an LDAP directory server to a X.500 DAP DSA.  This requires an LDAP/DAP gateway. OpenLDAP Software does not include such a gateway.

------

## 1.7. What is the difference between LDAPv2 and LDAPv3?

LDAPv3 was developed in the late 1990's to replace LDAPv2. LDAPv3 adds the following features to LDAP:

- Strong authentication and data security services via SASL
- Certificate authentication and data security services via TLS (SSL)
- Internationalization through the use of Unicode
- Referrals and Continuations
- Schema Discovery
- Extensibility (controls, extended operations, and more)

LDAPv2 is historic ([RFC3494](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3494.txt)).  As most *so-called* LDAPv2 implementations (including *slapd*(8)) do not conform to the LDAPv2 technical specification, interoperability  amongst implementations claiming LDAPv2 support is limited.  As LDAPv2  differs significantly from LDAPv3, deploying both LDAPv2 and LDAPv3  simultaneously is quite problematic.  LDAPv2 should be avoided. LDAPv2  is disabled by default.

------

## 1.8. LDAP vs RDBMS

This question is raised many times, in different forms. The most common, however, is: *Why doesn't OpenLDAP use a relational database management system (RDBMS) instead of an embedded key/value store like LMDB?* In general, expecting that the sophisticated algorithms implemented by commercial-grade RDBMS would make *OpenLDAP* be faster or somehow better and, at the same time, permitting sharing of data with other applications.

The short answer is that use of an embedded database and custom  indexing system allows OpenLDAP to provide greater performance and  scalability without loss of reliability. OpenLDAP uses LMDB concurrent / transactional database software.

Now for the long answer. We are all confronted all the time with the  choice RDBMSes vs. directories. It is a hard choice and no simple answer exists.

It is tempting to think that having a RDBMS backend to the directory  solves all problems. However, it is a pig. This is because the data  models are very different. Representing directory data with a relational database is going to require splitting data into multiple tables.

Think for a moment about the person objectclass. Its definition  requires attribute types objectclass, sn and cn and allows attribute  types userPassword, telephoneNumber, seeAlso and description. All of  these attributes are multivalued, so a normalization requires putting  each attribute type in a separate table.

Now you have to decide on appropriate keys for those tables. The  primary key might be a combination of the DN, but this becomes rather  inefficient on most database implementations.

The big problem now is that accessing data from one entry requires  seeking on different disk areas. On some applications this may be OK but in many applications performance suffers.

The only attribute types that can be put in the main table entry are  those that are mandatory and single-value. You may add also the optional single-valued attributes and set them to NULL or something if not  present.

But wait, the entry can have multiple objectclasses and they are  organized in an inheritance hierarchy. An entry of objectclass  organizationalPerson now has the attributes from person plus a few  others and some formerly optional attribute types are now mandatory.

What to do? Should we have different tables for the different  objectclasses? This way the person would have an entry on the person  table, another on organizationalPerson, etc. Or should we get rid of  person and put everything on the second table?

But what do we do with a filter like (cn=*) where cn is an attribute  type that appears in many, many objectclasses. Should we search all  possible tables for matching entries? Not very attractive.

Once this point is reached, three approaches come to mind. One is to  do full normalization so that each attribute type, no matter what, has  its own separate table. The simplistic approach where the DN is part of  the primary key is extremely wasteful, and calls for an approach where  the entry has a unique numeric id that is used instead for the keys and a main table that maps DNs to ids. The approach, anyway, is very  inefficient when several attribute types from one or more entries are  requested. Such a database, though cumbersomely, can be managed from SQL applications.

The second approach is to put the whole entry as a blob in a table  shared by all entries regardless of the objectclass and have additional  tables that act as indices for the first table. Index tables are not  database indices, but are fully managed by the LDAP server-side  implementation. However, the database becomes unusable from SQL. And,  thus, a fully fledged database system provides little or no advantage.  The full generality of the database is unneeded. Much better to use  something light and fast, like LMDB.

A completely different way to see this is to give up any hopes of  implementing the directory data model. In this case, LDAP is used as an  access protocol to data that provides only superficially the directory  data model. For instance, it may be read only or, where updates are  allowed, restrictions are applied, such as making single-value attribute types that would allow for multiple values. Or the impossibility to add new objectclasses to an existing entry or remove one of those present.  The restrictions span the range from allowed restrictions (that might be elsewhere the result of access control) to outright violations of the  data model. It can be, however, a method to provide LDAP access to  preexisting data that is used by other applications. But in the  understanding that we don't really have a "directory".

Existing commercial LDAP server implementations that use a relational database are either from the first kind or the third. I don't know of  any implementation that uses a relational database to do inefficiently  what LMDB does efficiently. For those who are interested in "third way"  (exposing EXISTING data from RDBMS as LDAP tree, having some limitations compared to classic LDAP model, but making it possible to interoperate  between LDAP and SQL applications):

OpenLDAP includes back-sql - the backend that makes it possible. It  uses ODBC + additional metainformation about translating LDAP queries to SQL queries in your RDBMS schema, providing different levels of access - from read-only to full access depending on RDBMS you use, and your  schema.

For more information on concept and limitations, see *slapd-sql*(5) man page, or the [Backends](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/backends.html) section. There are also several examples for several RDBMSes in `back-sql/rdbms_depend/*` subdirectories.

------

## 1.9. What is slapd and what can it do?

*slapd*(8) is an LDAP directory server that runs on many  different platforms. You can use it to provide a directory service of  your very own.  Your directory can contain pretty much anything you want to put in it. You can connect it to the global LDAP directory service,  or run a service all by yourself. Some of slapd's more interesting  features and capabilities include:

**LDAPv3**: *slapd* implements version 3 of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. *slapd* supports LDAP over both IPv4 and IPv6 and Unix IPC.

**Simple Authentication and Security Layer**: *slapd* supports strong authentication and data security (integrity and confidentiality) services through the use of SASL.  *slapd*'s SASL implementation utilizes [Cyrus SASL](https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/) software which supports a number of mechanisms including DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, and GSSAPI.

**Transport Layer Security**: *slapd* supports certificate-based authentication and data security (integrity and  confidentiality) services through the use of TLS (or SSL).  *slapd*'s TLS implementation can utilize [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) or [GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org/), software.

**Topology control**: *slapd* can be configured to restrict access at the socket layer based upon network topology information. This feature utilizes *TCP wrappers*.

**Access control**: *slapd* provides a rich and powerful  access control facility, allowing you to control access to the  information in your database(s). You can control access to entries based on LDAP authorization information, IP address, domain name and other criteria.  *slapd* supports both *static* and *dynamic* access control information.

**Internationalization**: *slapd* supports Unicode and language tags.

**Choice of database backends**: *slapd* comes with a variety of different database backends you can choose from. They include MDB, a hierarchical high-performance transactional database backend; and PASSWD, a simple backend interface to the *passwd*(5) file. The MDB backend utilizes LMDB.

**Multiple database instances**: *slapd* can be configured to serve multiple databases at the same time. This means that a single *slapd* server can respond to requests for many logically different portions of the LDAP tree, using the same or different database backends.

**Generic modules API**:  If you require even more customization, *slapd* lets you write your own modules easily. *slapd* consists of two distinct parts: a front end that handles protocol  communication with LDAP clients; and modules which handle specific tasks such as database operations.  Because these two pieces communicate via a well-defined C API, you can write your own customized modules which extend *slapd* in numerous ways.  Also, a number of *programmable database* modules are provided.  These allow you to expose external data sources to *slapd* using popular programming languages ([Perl](https://www.perl.org/), and SQL).

**Threads**: *slapd* is threaded for high performance.  A single multi-threaded *slapd* process handles all incoming requests using a pool of threads.  This  reduces the amount of system overhead required while providing high  performance.

**Replication**: *slapd* can be configured to maintain shadow copies of directory information.  This *single-provider/multiple-consumer* replication scheme is vital in high-volume environments where a single *slapd* installation just doesn't provide the necessary availability or  reliability.  For extremely demanding environments where a single point  of failure is not acceptable, *multi-provider* replication is also available. With *multi-provider* replication two or more nodes can accept write operations allowing for redundancy at the provider level.

*slapd* includes support for *LDAP Sync*-based replication.

**Proxy Cache**: *slapd* can be configured as a caching LDAP proxy service.

**Configuration**: *slapd* is highly configurable through a single configuration file which allows you to change just about  everything you'd ever want to change.  Configuration options have  reasonable defaults, making your job much easier. Configuration can also be performed dynamically using LDAP itself, which greatly improves  manageability.

------

## 1.10. What is lloadd and what can it do?

*lloadd*(8) is a daemon that provides an LDAPv3 load balancer service. It is responsible for distributing requests across a set of *slapd* instances.

See the [Load Balancing with lloadd](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/loadbalancer.html) chapter for information about how to configure and run *lloadd*(8).

Alternatively, the load balancer can run as a module embedded inside of *slapd*.  This is also described in the [Load Balancing with lloadd](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/loadbalancer.html) chapter.

开放式LDAP目录服务简介

本文档介绍如何构建、配置和操作Open  LDAP软件以提供目录服务。其中包括有关如何配置和运行独立LDAP守护程序slapd（8）的详细信息。它适用于新的和有经验的管理员。本节提供了目录服务的基本介绍，特别是slapd（8）提供的目录服务。本简介仅旨在提供足够的信息，以便开始了解LDAP、X.500和目录服务。

1.1.什么是目录服务？

目录是一个专门为搜索和浏览而设计的数据库，除了支持基本的查找和更新功能外。

注意：有些人将目录定义为仅针对读取访问进行优化的数据库。这个定义充其量过于简单化了。

目录往往包含描述性的、基于属性的信息，并支持复杂的过滤功能。目录通常不支持为处理大容量复杂更新而设计的数据库管理系统中的复杂事务或回滚方案。如果允许的话，目录更新通常是简单的要么全有要么全无的更改。目录通常经过调整，以便对大容量查找或搜索操作做出快速响应。他们可能能够广泛复制信息，以提高可用性和可靠性，同时减少响应时间。当复制目录信息时，只要及时解决不一致，消费者之间的临时不一致可能是可以的。

有许多不同的方式可以提供目录服务。不同的方法允许不同类型的信息存储在目录中，对如何引用、查询和更新信息，如何保护信息免受未经授权的访问等提出不同的要求。一些目录服务是本地的，为受限的上下文提供服务（例如，单台机器上的手指服务）。其他服务是全球性的，为更广泛的环境（例如，整个互联网）提供服务。全局服务通常是分布式的，这意味着它们包含的数据分布在许多机器上，所有这些机器都协同提供目录服务。通常，全局服务定义了一个统一的名称空间，该名称空间提供相同的数据视图，无论您处于与数据本身相关的位置。

web目录，例如Curlie项目提供的目录，是目录服务的一个很好的例子。这些服务对网页进行编目，专门设计用于支持浏览和搜索。

虽然有些人认为互联网域名系统（DNS）是全球分布式目录服务的一个例子，但DNS既不可浏览也不可搜索。它被更恰当地描述为一个全局分布的查找服务。

1.2.什么是LDAP？

LDAP代表轻量级目录访问协议。顾名思义，它是一种用于访问目录服务的轻量级协议，特别是基于X.500的目录服务。LDAP通过TCP/IP或其他面向连接的传输服务运行。LDAP是IETF标准跟踪协议，并在“轻量级目录访问协议（LDAP）技术规范路线图”RFC4510中指定。

本节从用户的角度对LDAP进行了概述。

什么样的信息可以存储在目录中？LDAP信息模型基于条目。条目是具有全局唯一可分辨名称（DN）的属性集合。DN用于明确地引用条目。条目的每个属性都有一个类型和一个或多个值。类型通常是助记符字符串，如“cn”表示常用名称，或“mail”表示电子邮件地址。值的语法取决于属性类型。例如，cn属性可能包含值Babs-Jensen。邮件属性可能包含值“babs@example.com“.jpeg照片属性将包含jpeg（二进制）格式的照片。

信息是如何安排的？在LDAP中，目录条目以分层树状结构排列。传统上，这种结构反映了地理和/或组织边界。代表国家/地区的条目显示在树的顶部。下面是代表国家和国家组织的条目。它们下面可能是代表组织单位、人员、打印机、文档的条目，或者你能想到的任何其他条目。图1.1显示了一个使用传统命名的LDAP目录树示例。

图1.1:LDAP目录树（传统命名）

该树也可以基于互联网域名进行排列。这种命名方法越来越受欢迎，因为它允许使用DNS定位目录服务。图1.2显示了使用基于域的nami的LDAP目录树示例

# A Quick-Start Guide

The following is a quick start guide to OpenLDAP Software 2.6, including the Standalone LDAP Daemon, *slapd*(8).

It is meant to walk you through the basic steps needed to install and configure [OpenLDAP Software](https://www.openldap.org/software/).  It should be used in conjunction with the other chapters of this  document, manual pages, and other materials provided with the  distribution (e.g. the `INSTALL` document) or on the [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) web site (http://www.OpenLDAP.org), in particular the OpenLDAP Software FAQ (http://www.OpenLDAP.org/faq/?file=2).

If you intend to run OpenLDAP Software seriously, you should review  all of this document before attempting to install the software.



------

**Note:** This quick start guide does not use strong  authentication nor any integrity or confidential protection services.   These services are described in other chapters of the OpenLDAP  Administrator's Guide.

------



 

1. **Get the software** 
    You can obtain a copy of the software by following the instructions on the OpenLDAP Software download page (http://www.openldap.org/software/download/).  It is recommended that new users start with the latest *release*. 
    

2. Unpack the distribution

   Pick a directory for the source to live under, change directory to  there, and unpack the distribution using the following commands:


   then relocate yourself into the distribution directory:


   You'll have to replace 

   VERSION

    with the version name of the release.

3. **Review documentation** 
    You should now review the `COPYRIGHT`, `LICENSE`, `README` and `INSTALL` documents provided with the distribution. The `COPYRIGHT` and `LICENSE` provide information on acceptable use, copying, and limitation of warranty of OpenLDAP Software. 
     
    You should also review other chapters of this document. In particular, the [Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/install.html) chapter of this document provides detailed information on prerequisite software and installation procedures. 
    

4. Run `configure`

   You will need to run the provided 

   configure

    script to 

   configure

    the distribution for building on your system.  The 

   configure

    script accepts many command line options that enable or disable  optional software features.  Usually the defaults are okay, but you may  want to change them.  To get a complete list of options that 

   configure

    accepts, use the 

   --help

    option:


   However, given that you are using this guide, we'll assume you are brave enough to just let 

   configure

    determine what's best:


   Assuming 

   configure

    doesn't dislike your system, you can proceed with building the software.  If 

   configure

    did complain, well, you'll likely need to go to the Software FAQ 

   Installation

    section (

   http://www.openldap.org/faq/?file=8

   ) and/or actually read the 

   Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software

    chapter of this document.

5. Build the software

   .

   The next step is to build the software.  This step has two parts, first  we construct dependencies and then we compile the software:


   Both makes should complete without error.

6. Test the build

   .

   To ensure a correct build, you should run the test suite (it only takes a few minutes):


   Tests which apply to your configuration will run and they should pass.   Some tests, such as the replication test, may be skipped.

7. Install the software

   .

   You are now ready to install the software; this usually requires 

   super-user

    privileges:


   Everything should now be installed under 

   /usr/local

    (or whatever installation prefix was used by 

   configure

   ).

8. Edit the configuration file

   .

   Use your favorite editor to edit the provided 

   slapd.ldif

    example (usually installed as 

   /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.ldif

   ) to contain a MDB database definition of the form:


   Be sure to replace 

   <MY-DOMAIN>

    and 

   <COM>

    with the appropriate domain components of your domain name.  For example, for 

   example.com

   , use:


   If your domain contains additional components, such as 

   eng.uni.edu.eu

   , use:


   Details regarding configuring 

   slapd

   (8) can be found in the 

   slapd-config

   (5) manual page and the 

   Configuring slapd

    chapter of this document.  Note that the specified olcDbDirectory must exist prior to starting 

   slapd

   (8).

9. Import the configuration database

   You are now ready to import your configuration database for use by 

   slapd

   (8), by running the command:

10. Start SLAPD

    .

    You are now ready to start the Standalone LDAP Daemon, 

    slapd

    (8), by running the command:


    To check to see if the server is running and configured correctly, you can run a search against it with 

    ldapsearch

    (1).  By default, 

    ldapsearch

     is installed as 

    /usr/local/bin/ldapsearch

    :


    Note the use of single quotes around command parameters to prevent  special characters from being interpreted by the shell.  This should  return:


    Details regarding running 

    slapd

    (8) can be found in the 

    slapd

    (8) manual page and the 

    Running slapd

     chapter of this document.

11. Add initial entries to your directory

    .

    You can use 

    ldapadd

    (1) to add entries to your LDAP directory. 

    ldapadd

     expects input in 

    LDIF

     form.  We'll do it in two steps:

    1. create an LDIF file
    2. run ldapadd

    Use your favorite editor and create an LDIF file that contains:


    Be sure to replace 

    <MY-DOMAIN>

     and 

    <COM>

     with the appropriate domain components of your domain name.  

    <MY ORGANIZATION>

     should be replaced with the name of your organization. When you cut and paste, be sure to trim any leading and trailing whitespace from the  example.


    Now, you may run 

    ldapadd

    (1) to insert these entries into your directory.


    Be sure to replace 

    <MY-DOMAIN>

     and 

    <COM>

     with the appropriate domain components of your domain name.  You will be prompted for the "

    secret

    " specified in 

    slapd.conf

    . For example, for 

    example.com

    , use:


    where 

    example.ldif

     is the file you created above.


    Additional information regarding directory creation can be found in the 

    Database Creation and Maintenance Tools

     chapter of this document.

12. See if it works

    .

    Now we're ready to verify the added entries are in your directory. You  can use any LDAP client to do this, but our example uses the 

    ldapsearch

    (1) tool.  Remember to replace 

    dc=example,dc=com

     with the correct values for your site:


    This command will search for and retrieve every entry in the database.

You are now ready to add more entries using *ldapadd*(1) or another LDAP client, experiment with various configuration options, backend arrangements, etc..

Note that by default, the *slapd*(8) database grants *read access to everybody* excepting the *super-user* (as specified by the `rootdn` configuration directive).  It is highly recommended that you establish  controls to restrict access to authorized users. Access controls are  discussed in the [Access Control](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/access-control.html) chapter. You are also encouraged to read the [Security Considerations](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/security.html), [Using SASL](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html) and [Using TLS](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/tls.html) sections.

The following chapters provide more detailed information on making, installing, and running *slapd*(8).

# The Big Picture - Configuration Choices

This section gives a brief overview of various LDAP directory configurations, and how your Standalone LDAP Daemon *slapd*(8) fits in with the rest of the world.

------

## 3.1. Local Directory Service

In this configuration, you run a *slapd*(8) instance which  provides directory service for your local domain only. It does not  interact with other directory servers in any way. This configuration is  shown in Figure 3.1.



![img](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/config_local.png)



Figure 3.1: Local service configuration.

Use this configuration if you are just starting out (it's the one the quick-start guide makes for you) or if you want to provide a local  service and are not interested in connecting to the rest of the world.  It's easy to upgrade to another configuration later if you want.

------

## 3.2. Local Directory Service with Referrals

In this configuration, you run a *slapd*(8) instance which  provides directory service for your local domain and configure it to  return referrals to other servers capable of handling requests.  You may run this service (or services) yourself or use one provided to you.  This configuration is shown in Figure 3.2.



![img](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/config_ref.png)



Figure 3.2: Local service with referrals

Use this configuration if you want to provide local service and  participate in the Global Directory,  or you want to delegate  responsibility for *subordinate* entries to another server.

------

## 3.3. Replicated Directory Service

slapd(8) includes support for *LDAP Sync*-based replication, called *syncrepl*, which may be used to maintain shadow copies of directory information on multiple directory servers.   In its most basic configuration, the *provider* is a syncrepl provider and one or more *consumer* (or *shadow*) are syncrepl consumers.  An example provider-consumer configuration is  shown in figure 3.3. Multi-Provider configurations are also supported.



![img](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/config_repl.png)



Figure 3.3: Replicated Directory Services

This configuration can be used in conjunction with either of the first two configurations in situations where a single *slapd*(8) instance does not provide the required reliability or availability.

------

## 3.4. Distributed Local Directory Service

In this configuration, the local service is partitioned into smaller services, each of which may be replicated, and *glued* together with *superior* and *subordinate* referrals.

# 4. Building and Installing OpenLDAP Software

This chapter details how to build and install the [OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) Software package including *slapd*(8), the Standalone LDAP Daemon.  Building and installing OpenLDAP Software requires several  steps: installing prerequisite software, configuring OpenLDAP Software  itself, making, and finally installing.  The following sections describe this process in detail.

------

## 4.1. Obtaining and Extracting the Software

You can obtain OpenLDAP Software from the project's download page at http://www.openldap.org/software/download/ or directly from the project's FTP service at [ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/](ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/OpenLDAP/).

The project makes available two series of packages for *general use*.  The project makes *releases* as new features and bug fixes come available.  Though the project takes steps to improve stability of these releases, it is common for problems to arise only after *release*.  The *stable* release is the latest *release* which has demonstrated stability through general use.

Users of OpenLDAP Software can choose, depending on their desire for the *latest features* versus *demonstrated stability*, the most appropriate series to install.

After downloading OpenLDAP Software, you need to extract the  distribution from the compressed archive file and change your working  directory to the top directory of the distribution:

`gunzip -c openldap-VERSION.tgz | tar xf -`   `cd openldap-VERSION`

You'll have to replace `VERSION` with the version name of the release.

You should now review the `COPYRIGHT`, `LICENSE`, `README` and `INSTALL` documents provided with the distribution.  The `COPYRIGHT` and `LICENSE` provide information on acceptable use, copying, and limitation of warranty of OpenLDAP Software. The `README` and `INSTALL` documents provide detailed information on prerequisite software and installation procedures.

------

## 4.2. Prerequisite software

OpenLDAP Software relies upon a number of software packages  distributed by third parties.  Depending on the features you intend to  use, you may have to download and install a number of additional  software packages.  This section details commonly needed third party  software packages you might have to install.  However, for an up-to-date prerequisite information, the `README` document should be  consulted.  Note that some of these third party packages may depend on  additional software packages.  Install each package per the installation instructions provided with it.

### 4.2.1. Transport Layer Security

OpenLDAP clients and servers require installation of [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) or [GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org/) TLS libraries to provide Transport Layer Security services.  Though some operating systems may provide these libraries as part of the base system or as an optional software component, OpenSSL  and GnuTLS often require separate installation.

OpenSSL is available from http://www.openssl.org/. GnuTLS is available from http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/.

OpenLDAP Software will not be fully LDAPv3 compliant unless OpenLDAP's `configure` detects a usable TLS library.

### 4.2.2. Simple Authentication and Security Layer

OpenLDAP clients and servers require installation of [Cyrus SASL](https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/) libraries to provide Simple Authentication and Security Layer services.  Though some operating systems may provide this library as  part of the base system or as an optional software component, Cyrus SASL often requires separate installation.

Cyrus SASL is available from http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html. Cyrus SASL will make use of OpenSSL and Kerberos/GSSAPI libraries if preinstalled.

OpenLDAP Software will not be fully LDAPv3 compliant unless OpenLDAP's configure detects a usable Cyrus SASL installation.

### 4.2.3. Kerberos Authentication Service

OpenLDAP clients and servers support Kerberos authentication services.  In particular, OpenLDAP supports the Kerberos V GSS-API SASL authentication mechanism known as the GSSAPI mechanism.  This feature requires, in addition to Cyrus SASL libraries, either [Heimdal](https://github.com/heimdal/) or [MIT Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) V libraries.

Heimdal Kerberos is available from https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/. MIT Kerberos is available from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/.

Use of strong authentication services, such as those provided by Kerberos, is highly recommended.

### 4.2.4. Database Software

OpenLDAP's *slapd*(8) MDB primary database backend uses the LMDB software included with the OpenLDAP source.  There is no need to download any additional software to have *MDB* support.

### 4.2.5. Threads

OpenLDAP is designed to take advantage of threads.  OpenLDAP supports POSIX *pthreads*, NT threads and a number of other varieties.  `configure` will complain if it cannot find a suitable thread subsystem.   If this occurs, please consult the `Software|Installation|Platform Hints` section of the OpenLDAP FAQ http://www.openldap.org/faq/.

### 4.2.6. TCP Wrappers

*slapd*(8) supports TCP Wrappers (IP level access control  filters) if preinstalled.  Use of TCP Wrappers or other IP-level access  filters (such as those provided by an IP-level firewall) is recommended  for servers containing non-public information.

------

## 4.3. Running configure

Now you should probably run the `configure` script with the `--help` option. This will give you a list of options that you can change when  building OpenLDAP.  Many of the features of OpenLDAP can be enabled or  disabled using this method.

```
        ./configure --help
```

The `configure` script also looks for certain variables on the command line and in the environment.  These include:

| **Variable** | **Description**                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `CC`         | Specify alternative C Compiler    |
| `CFLAGS`     | Specify additional compiler flags |
| `CPPFLAGS`   | Specify C Preprocessor flags      |
| `LDFLAGS`    | Specify linker flags              |
| `LIBS`       | Specify additional libraries      |

Now run the configure script with any desired configuration options or variables.

```
        ./configure [options] [variable=value ...]
```

As an example, let's assume that we want to install OpenLDAP with MDB backend and TCP Wrappers support.  By default, MDB is enabled and TCP  Wrappers is not.  So, we just need to specify `--enable-wrappers` to include TCP Wrappers support:

```
        ./configure --enable-wrappers
```

However, this will fail to locate dependent software not installed in system directories.  For example, if TCP Wrappers headers and libraries are installed in `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib` respectively, the `configure` script should typically be called as follows:

```
        ./configure --enable-wrappers \
                CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" \
                LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib"
```

The `configure` script will normally auto-detect appropriate  settings.  If you have problems at this stage, consult any platform  specific hints and check your `configure` options, if any.

------

## 4.4. Building the Software

Once you have run the `configure` script the last line of output should be:

```
        Please "make depend" to build dependencies
```

If the last line of output does not match, `configure` has failed, and you will need to review its output to determine what went wrong. You should not proceed until `configure` completes successfully.

To build dependencies, run:

```
        make depend
```

Now build the software, this step will actually compile OpenLDAP.

```
        make
```

You should examine the output of this command carefully to make sure  everything is built correctly.  Note that this command builds the LDAP  libraries and associated clients as well as *slapd*(8).

------

## 4.5. Testing the Software

Once the software has been properly configured and successfully made, you should run the test suite to verify the build.

```
        make test
```

Tests which apply to your configuration will run and they should  pass. Some tests, such as the replication test, may be skipped if not  supported by your configuration.

------

## 4.6. Installing the Software

Once you have successfully tested the software, you are ready to  install it.  You will need to have write permission to the installation  directories you specified when you ran configure.  By default OpenLDAP  Software is installed in `/usr/local`.  If you changed this setting with the `--prefix` configure option, it will be installed in the location you provided.

Typically, the installation requires *super-user* privileges. From the top level OpenLDAP source directory, type:

```
        su root -c 'make install'
```

and enter the appropriate password when requested.

You should examine the output of this command carefully to make sure  everything is installed correctly. You will find the configuration files for *slapd*(8) in `/usr/local/etc/openldap` by default.  See the chapter [Configuring slapd](https://openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconf2.html) for additional information.

# 5. Configuring slapd

Once the software has been built and installed, you are ready to configure *slapd*(8) for use at your site.

OpenLDAP 2.3 and later have transitioned to using a dynamic runtime configuration engine, *slapd-config*(5).  *slapd-config*(5)

- is fully LDAP-enabled
- is managed using the standard LDAP operations
- stores its configuration data in an LDIF database, generally in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d` directory.
- allows all of slapd's configuration options to be changed on  the fly, generally without requiring a server restart for the changes to take effect.

This chapter describes the general format of the *slapd-config*(5) configuration system, followed by a detailed description of commonly used settings.

The older style *slapd.conf*(5) file is still supported, but  its use is deprecated and support for it will be withdrawn in a future  OpenLDAP release.  Configuring *slapd*(8) via *slapd.conf*(5) is described in the next chapter.

Refer to *slapd*(8) for information on how to have slapd automatically convert from *slapd.conf*(5) to *slapd-config*(5).



------

**Note:** Although the *slapd-config*(5) system stores its configuration as (text-based) LDIF files, you should *never* edit any of the LDIF files directly.  Configuration changes should be performed via LDAP operations, e.g. *ldapadd*(1), *ldapdelete*(1), or *ldapmodify*(1). For offline modifications (when the server is not running), use *slapadd*(8) and *slapmodify*(8).

------





------

**Note:** You will need to continue to use the older *slapd.conf*(5) configuration system if your OpenLDAP installation requires the use of  one or more backends or overlays that have not been updated to use the *slapd-config*(5) system.  As of OpenLDAP 2.4.33, all of the official backends have been  updated.  There may be additional contributed or experimental overlays  that also have not been updated.

------



------

## 5.1. Configuration Layout

The slapd configuration is stored as a special LDAP directory with a  predefined schema and DIT. There are specific objectClasses used to  carry global configuration options, schema definitions, backend and  database definitions, and assorted other items. A sample config tree is  shown in Figure 5.1.



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/config_dit.png)



Figure 5.1: Sample configuration tree.

Other objects may be part of the configuration but were omitted from the illustration for clarity.

The *slapd-config* configuration tree has a very specific structure. The root of the tree is named `cn=config` and contains global configuration settings. Additional settings are contained in separate child entries:

- Dynamically loaded modules
- Schema definitions
- Backend-specific configuration
- Database-specific configuration

The usual rules for LDIF files apply to the configuration information: Comment lines beginning with a '`#`' character are ignored.  If a line begins with a single space, it is  considered a continuation of the previous line (even if the previous  line is a comment) and the single leading space is removed. Entries are  separated by blank lines.

The general layout of the config LDIF is as follows:

```
        # global configuration settings
        dn: cn=config
        objectClass: olcGlobal
        cn: config
        <global config settings>

        # schema definitions
        dn: cn=schema,cn=config
        objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
        cn: schema
        <system schema>

        dn: cn={X}core,cn=schema,cn=config
        objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
        cn: {X}core
        <core schema>

        # additional user-specified schema
        ...

        # backend definitions
        dn: olcBackend=<typeA>,cn=config
        objectClass: olcBackendConfig
        olcBackend: <typeA>
        <backend-specific settings>

        # database definitions
        dn: olcDatabase={X}<typeA>,cn=config
        objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
        olcDatabase: {X}<typeA>
        <database-specific settings>

        # subsequent definitions and settings
        ...
```

Some of the entries listed above have a numeric index `"{X}"`  in their names. While most configuration settings have an inherent  ordering dependency (i.e., one setting must take effect before a  subsequent one may be set), LDAP databases are inherently unordered. The numeric index is used to enforce a consistent ordering in the  configuration database, so that all ordering dependencies are preserved. In most cases the index does not have to be provided; it will be  automatically generated based on the order in which entries are created.

Configuration directives are specified as values of individual  attributes. Most of the attributes and objectClasses used in the slapd  configuration have a prefix of `"olc"` (OpenLDAP Configuration)  in their names. Generally there is a one-to-one correspondence between  the attributes and the old-style `slapd.conf` configuration keywords, using the keyword as the attribute name, with the "olc" prefix attached.

A configuration directive may take arguments.  If so, the arguments  are separated by whitespace.  If an argument contains whitespace, the  argument should be enclosed in double quotes `"like this"`. In the descriptions that follow, arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets `<>`.

The distribution contains an example configuration file that will be installed in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap` directory. A number of files containing schema definitions (attribute types and object classes) are also provided in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema` directory.

------

## 5.2. Configuration Directives

This section details commonly used configuration directives.  For a complete list, see the *slapd-config*(5) manual page.  This section will treat the configuration directives in a top-down order, starting with the global directives in the `cn=config` entry. Each directive will be described along with its default value (if any) and an example of its use.

### 5.2.1. cn=config

Directives contained in this entry generally apply to the server as a whole. Most of them are system or connection oriented, not database  related. This entry must have the `olcGlobal` objectClass.

#### 5.2.1.1. olcIdleTimeout: <integer>

Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an idle client connection.  A value of 0, the default, disables this feature.

#### 5.2.1.2. olcLogLevel: <level>

This directive specifies the level at which log statements and  operation statistics should be sent to syslog (currently logged to the *syslogd*(8) `LOG_LOCAL4` facility). You must have configured OpenLDAP `--enable-debug` (the default) for this to work, except for the two statistics levels,  which are always enabled. Log levels may be specified as integers or by  keyword. Multiple log levels may be used and the levels are additive.  The possible values for <level> are:

| **Level** | **Keyword**    | **Description**                                              |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -1        | any            | enable all debugging                                         |
| 0         |                | no debugging                                                 |
| 1         | (0x1 trace)    | trace function calls                                         |
| 2         | (0x2 packets)  | debug packet handling                                        |
| 4         | (0x4 args)     | heavy trace debugging                                        |
| 8         | (0x8 conns)    | connection management                                        |
| 16        | (0x10 BER)     | print out packets sent and received                          |
| 32        | (0x20 filter)  | search filter processing                                     |
| 64        | (0x40 config)  | configuration processing                                     |
| 128       | (0x80 ACL)     | access control list processing                               |
| 256       | (0x100 stats)  | stats log connections/operations/results                     |
| 512       | (0x200 stats2) | stats log entries sent                                       |
| 1024      | (0x400 shell)  | print communication with shell backends                      |
| 2048      | (0x800 parse)  | print entry parsing debugging                                |
| 16384     | (0x4000 sync)  | syncrepl consumer processing                                 |
| 32768     | (0x8000 none)  | only messages that get logged regardless of configured log level |

The desired log level can be input as a single integer that combines  the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal or in hexadecimal notation,  as a list of integers (that are ORed internally), or as a list of the  names that are shown between brackets, such that

```
                olcLogLevel 129
                olcLogLevel 0x81
                olcLogLevel 128 1
                olcLogLevel 0x80 0x1
                olcLogLevel acl trace
```

are equivalent.

Examples:

```
 olcLogLevel -1
```

This will enable all log levels.

```
 olcLogLevel conns filter
```

Just log the connection and search filter processing.

```
 olcLogLevel none
```

Log those messages that are logged regardless of the configured  loglevel. This differs from setting the log level to 0, when no logging  occurs. At least the `None` level is required to have high priority messages logged.

Default:

```
 olcLogLevel stats
```

Basic stats logging is configured by default.

#### 5.2.1.3. olcReferral <URI>

This directive specifies the referral to pass back when slapd cannot find a local database to handle a request.

Example:

```
        olcReferral: ldap://root.openldap.org
```

This will refer non-local queries to the global root LDAP server at  the OpenLDAP Project. Smart LDAP clients can re-ask their query at that  server, but note that most of these clients are only going to know how  to handle simple LDAP URLs that contain a host part and optionally a  distinguished name part.

#### 5.2.1.4. Sample Entry

```
dn: cn=config
objectClass: olcGlobal
cn: config
olcIdleTimeout: 30
olcLogLevel: Stats
olcReferral: ldap://root.openldap.org
```

### 5.2.2. cn=module

If support for dynamically loaded modules was enabled when configuring slapd, `cn=module` entries may be used to specify sets of modules to load. Module entries must have the `olcModuleList` objectClass.

#### 5.2.2.1. olcModuleLoad: <filename>

Specify the name of a dynamically loadable module to load. The  filename may be an absolute path name or a simple filename. Non-absolute names are searched for in the directories specified by the `olcModulePath` directive.

#### 5.2.2.2. olcModulePath: <pathspec>

Specify a list of directories to search for loadable modules.  Typically the path is colon-separated but this depends on the operating  system.

#### 5.2.2.3. Sample Entries

```
dn: cn=module{0},cn=config

### 5.2.3. cn=schema

The cn=schema entry holds all of the schema definitions that are  hard-coded in slapd. As such, the values in this entry are generated by  slapd so no schema values need to be provided in the config file. The  entry must still be defined though, to serve as a base for the  user-defined schema to add in underneath. Schema entries must have the `olcSchemaConfig` objectClass.

####  5.2.3.1. olcAttributeTypes: <[RFC4512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt) Attribute Type Description>

This directive defines an attribute type. Please see the [Schema Specification](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html) chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.

####  5.2.3.2. olcObjectClasses: <[RFC4512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt) Object Class Description>

This directive defines an object class. Please see the [Schema Specification](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html) chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.

#### 5.2.3.3. Sample Entries

```
dn: cn=schema,cn=config

olcObjectClasses: ( 1.1.3 NAME 'testObject'
  MAY ( testAttr $ testTwo ) AUXILIARY )
```

### 5.2.4. Backend-specific Directives

Backend directives apply to all database instances of the same type  and, depending on the directive, may be overridden by database  directives. Backend entries must have the `olcBackendConfig` objectClass.

#### 5.2.4.1. olcBackend: <type>

This directive names a backend-specific configuration entry. `<type>` should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 5.2.

| **Types**  | **Description**                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `asyncmet` | a       Asynchronous Metadirectory backend            |
| `config`   | Slapd configuration backend                           |
| `dnssrv`   | DNS SRV backend                                       |
| `ldap`     | Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Proxy) backend |
| `ldif`     | Lightweight Data Interchange Format backend           |
| `mdb`      | Memory-Mapped DB backend                              |
| `meta`     | Metadirectory backend                                 |
| `monitor`  | Monitor backend                                       |
| `null`     | Null backend                                          |
| `passwd`   | Provides read-only access to *passwd*(5)              |
| `perl`     | Perl Programmable backend                             |
| `relay`    | Relay backend                                         |
| `sock`     | Socket backend                                        |
| `sql`      | SQL Programmable backend                              |
| `wt`       | WiredTiger backend                                    |

Example:

```
        olcBackend: mdb
```

This marks the beginning of a new MDB backend  definition. At present, only back-mdb implements any options of this  type, so this setting is not needed for any other backends.

#### 5.2.4.2. Sample Entry

```
 dn: olcBackend=mdb,cn=config
 objectClass: olcBackendConfig
 olcBackend: mdb
 olcBkMdbIdlExp: 16
```

### 5.2.5. Database-specific Directives

Directives in this section are supported by every type of database. Database entries must have the `olcDatabaseConfig` objectClass.

#### 5.2.5.1. olcDatabase: [{<index>}]<type>

This directive names a specific database instance. The numeric  {<index>} may be provided to distinguish multiple databases of the same type. Usually the index can be omitted, and slapd will generate it automatically. `<type>` should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 5.2 or the `frontend` type.

The `frontend` is a special database that is used to hold  database-level options that should be applied to all the other  databases. Subsequent database definitions may also override some  frontend settings.

The `config` database is also special; both the `config` and the `frontend` databases are always created implicitly even if they are not explicitly configured, and they are created before any other databases.

Example:

```
        olcDatabase: mdb
```

This marks the beginning of a new MDB database instance.

#### 5.2.5.2. olcAccess: to <what> [ by <who> [<accesslevel>] [<control>] ]+

This directive grants access (specified by <accesslevel>) to a  set of entries and/or attributes (specified by <what>) by one or  more requestors (specified by <who>). See the [Access Control](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/access-control.html) section of this guide for basic usage.



------

**Note:** If no `olcAccess` directives are specified, the default access control policy, `to * by * read`, allows all users (both authenticated and anonymous) read access.

------





------

**Note:** Access controls defined in the frontend are appended to all other databases' controls.

------



#### 5.2.5.3. olcReadonly { TRUE | FALSE }

This directive puts the database into "read-only" mode. Any attempts  to modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.  If  set on a consumer, modifications sent by syncrepl will still occur.

Default:

```
        olcReadonly: FALSE
```

#### 5.2.5.4. olcRootDN: <DN>

This directive specifies the DN that is not subject to access control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database.   The DN need not refer to an entry in this database or even in the  directory. The DN may refer to a SASL identity.

Entry-based Example:

```
        olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
```

SASL-based Example:

```
        olcRootDN: uid=root,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
```

See the [SASL Authentication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#SASL Authentication) section for information on SASL authentication identities.

#### 5.2.5.5. olcRootPW: <password>

This directive can be used to specify a password for the DN for the rootdn (when the rootdn is set to a DN within the database).

Example:

```
        olcRootPW: secret
```

It is also permissible to provide a hash of the password in [RFC2307](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt) form.  *slappasswd*(8) may be used to generate the password hash.

Example:

```
        olcRootPW: {SSHA}ZKKuqbEKJfKSXhUbHG3fG8MDn9j1v4QN
```

The hash was generated using the command `slappasswd -s secret`.

#### 5.2.5.6. olcSizeLimit: <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.

Default:

```
        olcSizeLimit: 500
```

See the [Limits](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/limits.html) section of this guide and slapd-config(5) for more details.

#### 5.2.5.7. olcSuffix: <dn suffix>

This directive specifies the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend database. Multiple suffix lines can be given, and  usually at least one is required for each database definition. (Some  backend types, such as `frontend` and `monitor` use a hard-coded suffix which may not be overridden in the configuration.)

Example:

```
        olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
```

Queries with a DN ending in "dc=example,dc=com" will be passed to this backend.



------

**Note:** When the backend to pass a query to is selected,  slapd looks at the suffix value(s) in each database definition in the  order in which they were configured. Thus, if one database suffix is a  prefix of another, it must appear after it in the configuration.

------



#### 5.2.5.8. olcSyncrepl

```
        olcSyncrepl: rid=<replica ID>
                provider=ldap[s]://<hostname>[:port]
                [type=refreshOnly|refreshAndPersist]

                [tls_key=<file>]
                [tls_cacert=<file>]
                [tls_cacertdir=<path>]
                [tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]

                [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]
                [logbase=<base DN>]
                [logfilter=<filter str>]
                [syncdata=default|accesslog|changelog]
```

This directive specifies the current database as a consumer of the provider content by establishing the current *slapd*(8) as a replication consumer site running a syncrepl replication engine.  The provider database is located at the provider site specified by the `provider` parameter. The consumer database is kept up-to-date with the provider  content using the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol. See [RFC4533](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt) for more information on the protocol.

The `rid` parameter is used for identification of the current `syncrepl` directive within the replication consumer server, where `<replica ID>` uniquely identifies the syncrepl specification described by the current `syncrepl` directive. `<replica ID>` is non-negative and is no more than three decimal digits in length.

The `provider` parameter specifies the replication provider site containing the provider content as an LDAP URI. The `provider` parameter specifies a scheme, a host and optionally a port where the  provider slapd instance can be found. Either a domain name or IP address may be used for <hostname>. Examples are `ldap://provider.example.com:389` or `ldaps://192.168.1.1:636`. If <port> is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or  636) is used. Note that the syncrepl uses a consumer-initiated protocol, and hence its specification is located on the consumer.

The content of the syncrepl consumer is defined using a search  specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send search  requests to the provider slapd according to the search specification.  The search specification includes `searchbase`, `scope`, `filter`, `attrs`, `exattrs`, `attrsonly`, `sizelimit`, and `timelimit` parameters as in the normal search specification. The `searchbase` parameter has no default value and must always be specified. The `scope` defaults to `sub`, the `filter` defaults to `(objectclass=*)`, `attrs` defaults to `"*,+"` to replicate all user and operational attributes, and `attrsonly` is unset by default. Both `sizelimit` and `timelimit` default to "unlimited", and only positive integers or "unlimited" may be specified. The `exattrs` option may also be used to specify attributes that should be omitted from incoming entries.

The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types: `refreshOnly` and `refreshAndPersist`. The operation type is specified by the `type` parameter. In the `refreshOnly` operation, the next synchronization search operation is periodically  rescheduled at an interval time after each synchronization operation  finishes. The interval is specified by the `interval` parameter. It is set to one day by default. In the `refreshAndPersist` operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the provider *slapd* instance. Further updates to the provider will generate `searchResultEntry` to the consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent synchronization search.

If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt to  reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of the  <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs. For example,  retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for the  first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next three times before stop retrying. + in <#  of retries> means indefinite  number of retries until success.

The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site by turning on the `schemachecking` parameter. If it is turned on, every replicated entry will be checked  for its schema as the entry is stored on the consumer. Every entry in  the consumer should contain those attributes required by the schema  definition. If it is turned off, entries will be stored without checking schema conformance. The default is off.

The `binddn` parameter gives the DN to bind as for the  syncrepl searches to the provider slapd. It should be a DN which has  read access to the replication content in the provider database.

The `bindmethod` is `simple` or `sasl`, depending on whether simple password-based authentication or SASL authentication is to be used when connecting to the provider *slapd* instance.

Simple authentication should not be used unless adequate data  integrity and confidentiality protections are in place (e.g. TLS or  IPsec). Simple authentication requires specification of `binddn` and `credentials` parameters.

SASL authentication is generally recommended.  SASL authentication requires specification of a mechanism using the `saslmech` parameter. Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using `authcid` and `credentials`, respectively.  The `authzid` parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.

The `realm` parameter specifies a realm which a certain mechanisms authenticate the identity within. The `secprops` parameter specifies Cyrus SASL security properties.

The `starttls` parameter specifies use of the StartTLS  extended operation to establish a TLS session before authenticating to  the provider. If the `critical` argument is supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS request fails.  Otherwise the syncrepl  session continues without TLS.  The tls_reqcert setting defaults to `"demand"` and the other TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings.

Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs of data modifications.  This mode of operation is referred to as *delta syncrepl*.  In addition to the above parameters, the `logbase` and `logfilter` parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will be used. The `syncdata` parameter must be set to either `"accesslog"` if the log conforms to the *slapo-accesslog*(5) log format, or `"changelog"` if the log conforms to the obsolete *changelog* format. If the `syncdata` parameter is omitted or set to `"default"` then the log parameters are ignored.

The *syncrepl* replication mechanism is supported by the *mdb* backend.

See the [LDAP Sync Replication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#LDAP Sync Replication) chapter of this guide for more information on how to use this directive.

#### 5.2.5.9. olcTimeLimit: <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will spend answering a search request. If a request is not  finished in this time, a result indicating an exceeded timelimit will be returned.

Default:

```
        olcTimeLimit: 3600
```

See the [Limits](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/limits.html) section of this guide and slapd-config(5) for more details.

#### 5.2.5.10. olcUpdateref: <URL>

This directive is only applicable in a *replica* (or *shadow*) *slapd*(8) instance. It specifies the URL to return to clients which submit update requests upon the replica. If specified multiple times, each URL is provided.

Example:

```
        olcUpdateref:   ldap://provider.example.net
```

#### 5.2.5.11. Sample Entries

```
dn: olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config
objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
objectClass: olcFrontendConfig
olcDatabase: frontend
olcReadOnly: FALSE

dn: olcDatabase=config,cn=config
objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
olcDatabase: config
olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
```

### 5.2.6. MDB Backend Directives

Directives in this category only apply to the MDB  database backend. They will apply to all "database mdb" instances in the configuration. For a complete reference of MDB backend configuration  directives, see *slapd-mdb*(5).

#### 5.2.6.1. olcBkMdbIdlExp <exponent>

Specify a power of 2 for the maximum size of an index slot. The  default is 16, yielding a maximum slot size of 2^16 or 65536. The  specified value must be in the range of 16-30.

This setting helps with the case where certain search filters are  slow to return results due to an index slot having collapsed to a range  value.  This occurs when the number of candidate entries that match the  filter for the index slot exceed the configured slot size.

If this setting is decreased on a server with existing MDB databases, each db will immediately need its indices to be rebuilt while slapd is offline with the "slapindex -q -t" command.

If this setting is increased on a server with existing MDB databases, each db will need its indices rebuilt to take advantage of  the change for indices that have already been converted to ranges.

### 5.2.7. MDB Database Directives

Directives in this category apply to the MDB database  backend. They are used in an olcDatabase entry in addition to the  generic database directives defined above.  For a complete reference of  MDB configuration directives, see *slapd-mdb*(5). In addition to the `olcDatabaseConfig` objectClass, MDB database entries must have the `olcMdbConfig` objectClass.

#### 5.2.7.1. olcDbDirectory: <directory>

This directive specifies the directory where the MDB files containing the database and associated indices live.

Default:

```
        olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
```

#### 5.2.7.2. olcDbCheckpoint: <kbyte> <min>

This directive specifies the frequency for flushing the database disk buffers. This directive is only needed if the *olcDbNoSync* option is `TRUE`. The checkpoint will occur if either <kbyte> data has been written or <min> minutes have passed since the last checkpoint. Both  arguments default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When the  <min> argument is non-zero, an internal task will run every  <min> minutes to perform the checkpoint. Note: currently the  _kbyte_ setting is unimplemented.

Example:

```
        olcDbCheckpoint: 1024 10
```

#### 5.2.7.3. olcDbEnvFlags: {nosync,nometasync,writemap,mapasync,nordahead}

This option specifies flags for finer-grained control of  the  LMDB  library's operation.

- `nosync`: This is exactly the same as the dbnosync directive.
- `nometasync`: Flush the data on a commit, but skip the  sync of the meta page. This mode is slightly faster than doing a full  sync, but can potentially lose the last committed transaction if the  operating system crashes. If both nometasync and nosync are set, the  nosync flag takes precedence.
- `writemap`: Use a writable memory map instead of just  read-only. This speeds up write operations but makes the database  vulnerable to corruption in case any bugs in slapd cause stray writes  into the mmap region.
- `mapasync`: When using a writable memory map and  performing flushes on each commit, use an asynchronous flush instead of a synchronous flush (the default). This option has no effect if writemap  has not been set. It also has no effect if nosync is set.
- `nordahead`: Turn off file readahead. Usually the OS  performs readahead on every read request. This usually boosts read  performance but can be harmful to random access read performance if the  system's memory is full and the DB is larger than RAM. This option is  not implemented on Windows.

#### 5.2.7.4. olcDbIndex: {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

This directive specifies the indices to maintain for the given attribute. If only an `<attrlist>` is given, the default indices are maintained. The index keywords  correspond to the common types of matches that may be used in an LDAP  search filter.

Example:

```
        olcDbIndex: default pres,eq
        olcDbIndex: uid
        olcDbIndex: cn,sn pres,eq,sub
        olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
```

The first line sets the default set of indices to maintain to present and equality.  The second line causes the default (pres,eq) set of  indices to be maintained for the `uid` attribute type. The third line causes present, equality, and substring indices to be maintained for `cn` and `sn` attribute types.  The fourth line causes an equality index for the `objectClass` attribute type.

There is no index keyword for inequality matches. Generally these  matches do not use an index. However, some attributes do support  indexing for inequality matches, based on the equality index.

A substring index can be more explicitly specified as `subinitial`, `subany`, or `subfinal`, corresponding to the three possible components of a substring match  filter. A subinitial index only indexes substrings that appear at the  beginning of an attribute value. A subfinal index only indexes  substrings that appear at the end of an attribute value, while subany  indexes substrings that occur anywhere in a value.

Note that by default, setting an index for an attribute also affects  every subtype of that attribute. E.g., setting an equality index on the `name` attribute causes `cn`, `sn`, and every other attribute that inherits from `name` to be indexed.

By default, no indices are maintained.  It is generally advised that minimally an equality index upon objectClass be maintained.

```
        olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
```

Additional indices should be configured corresponding to the most  common searches that are used on the database. Presence indexing should  not be configured for an attribute unless the attribute occurs very  rarely in the database, and presence searches on the attribute occur  very frequently during normal use of the directory. Most applications  don't use presence searches, so usually presence indexing is not very  useful.

If this setting is changed while slapd is running, an internal task  will be run to generate the changed index data. All server operations  can continue as normal while the indexer does its work.  If slapd is  stopped before the index task completes, indexing will have to be  manually completed using the slapindex tool.

#### 5.2.7.5. olcDbMaxEntrySize: <bytes>

Specify the maximum size of an entry in bytes. Attempts to store an  entry larger than this size will be rejected with the error  LDAP_ADMINLIMIT_EXCEEDED. The default is 0, which is unlimited.

#### 5.2.7.6. olcDbMaxReaders: <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of threads that may have  concurrent read access to the database. Tools such as slapcat count as a single thread, in addition to threads in any active slapd processes.  The default is 126.

#### 5.2.7.7. olcDbMaxSize: <bytes>

This directive specifies the maximum size of the database in bytes. A memory map of this size is allocated at startup time and the database  will not be allowed to grow beyond this size. The default is 10485760  bytes (10MB). This setting may be changed upward if the configured limit needs to be increased.



------

**Note:** It is important to set this to as large a value  as possible, (relative to anticipated growth of the actual data over  time) since growing the size later may not be practical when the system  is under heavy load.

------



#### 5.2.7.8. olcDbMode: { <octal> | <symbolic> }

This directive specifies the file protection mode that newly created database index files should have. This can be in the form `0600` or `-rw-------`

Default:

```
        olcDbMode: 0600
```

#### 5.2.7.9. olcDbMultival: { <attrlist> | default } <integer> hi,<integer> lo

Specify the number of values for which a multivalued attribute is  stored in a separate table. Normally entries are stored as a single blob inside the database. When an entry gets very large or contains  attributes with a very large number of values, modifications on that  entry may get very slow. Splitting the large attributes out to a  separate table can improve the performance of modification operations.  The threshold is specified as a pair of integers. If the number of  values exceeds the hi threshold the values will be split out. If a  modification deletes enough values to bring an attribute below the lo  threshold the values will be removed from the separate table and merged  back into the main entry blob. The threshold can be set for a specific  list of attributes, or the default can be configured for all other  attributes. The default value for both hi and lo thresholds is UINT_MAX, which keeps all attributes in the main blob.

In addition to increasing write performance of operations the use of multival can also decrease fragmentation of the primary MDB database.

#### 5.2.7.10. olcDbRtxnsize: <entries>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to process in a single read transaction when executing a large search. Long-lived read  transactions prevent old database pages from being reused in write  transactions, and so can cause significant growth of the database file  when there is heavy write traffic. This setting causes the read  transaction in large searches to be released and reacquired after the  given number of entries has been read, to give writers the opportunity  to reclaim old database pages. The default is 10000.

#### 5.2.7.11. olcDbSearchStack: <integer>

Specify the depth of the stack used for search filter evaluation. Search filters are evaluated on a stack to accommodate nested `AND` / `OR` clauses. An individual stack is allocated for each server thread. The  depth of the stack determines how complex a filter can be evaluated  without requiring any additional memory allocation. Filters that are  nested deeper than the search stack depth will cause a separate stack to be allocated for that particular search operation. These separate  allocations can have a major negative impact on server performance, but  specifying too much stack will also consume a great deal of memory. Each search uses 512K bytes per level on a 32-bit machine, or 1024K bytes  per level on a 64-bit machine. The default stack depth is 16, thus 8MB  or 16MB per thread is used on 32 and 64 bit machines, respectively. Also the 512KB size of a single stack slot is set by a compile-time constant which may be changed if needed; the code must be recompiled for the  change to take effect.

Default:

```
        olcDbSearchStack: 16
```

#### 5.2.7.12. olcDbNosync: { TRUE | FALSE }

This directive causes on-disk database contents to not be immediately synchronized with in memory changes upon change.  Setting this option  to `TRUE` may improve performance at the expense of data integrity.

#### 5.2.7.13. Sample Entry

```
dn: olcDatabase=mdb,cn=config
objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
objectClass: olcMdbConfig
olcDatabase: mdb
olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
```

## 5.3. Configuration Example

The following is an example configuration, interspersed with  explanatory text. It defines two databases to handle different parts of  the X.500 tree; both are MDB database  instances. The line numbers shown are provided for reference only and  are not included in the actual file. First, the global configuration  section:

```
  1.    # example config file - global configuration entry
  2.    dn: cn=config
  3.    objectClass: olcGlobal
  4.    cn: config
  5.    olcReferral: ldap://root.openldap.org
  6.
```

Line 1 is a comment. Lines 2-4 identify this as the global configuration entry. The `olcReferral:` directive on line 5 means that queries not local to one of the  databases defined below will be referred to the LDAP server running on  the standard port (389) at the host `root.openldap.org`. Line 6 is a blank line, indicating the end of this entry.

```
  7.    # internal schema
  8.    dn: cn=schema,cn=config
  9.    objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
 10.    cn: schema
 11.
```

Line 7 is a comment. Lines 8-10 identify this as the root of the  schema subtree. The actual schema definitions in this entry are  hardcoded into slapd so no additional attributes are specified here.  Line 11 is a blank line, indicating the end of this entry.

```
 12.    # include the core schema
 13.    include: file:///usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.ldif
 14.
```

Line 12 is a comment. Line 13 is an LDIF include directive which accesses the *core* schema definitions in LDIF format. Line 14 is a blank line.

Next comes the database definitions. The first database is the special `frontend` database whose settings are applied globally to all the other databases.

```
 15.    # global database parameters
 16.    dn: olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config
 17.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 18.    olcDatabase: frontend
 19.    olcAccess: to * by * read
 20.
```

Line 15 is a comment. Lines 16-18 identify this entry as the global  database entry. Line 19 is a global access control. It applies to all  entries (after any applicable database-specific access controls). Line  20 is a blank line.

The next entry defines the config backend.

```
 21.    # set a rootpw for the config database so we can bind.
 22.    # deny access to everyone else.
 23.    dn: olcDatabase=config,cn=config
 24.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 25.    olcDatabase: config
 26.    olcRootPW: {SSHA}XKYnrjvGT3wZFQrDD5040US592LxsdLy
 27.    olcAccess: to * by * none
 28.
```

Lines 21-22 are comments. Lines 23-25 identify this entry as the config database entry. Line 26 defines the *super-user* password for this database. (The DN defaults to *"cn=config"*.) Line 27 denies all access to this database, so only the super-user will be able to access it. (This is already the default access on the config database. It is just listed here for illustration, and to reiterate  that unless a means to authenticate as the super-user is explicitly  configured, the config database will be inaccessible.)

Line 28 is a blank line.

The next entry defines an MDB backend that will handle queries for  things in the "dc=example,dc=com" portion of the tree. Indices are to be maintained for several attributes, and the `userPassword` attribute is to be protected from unauthorized access.

```
 29.    # MDB definition for example.com
 30.    dn: olcDatabase=mdb,cn=config
 31.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 32.    objectClass: olcMdbConfig
 33.    olcDatabase: mdb
 34.    olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
 35.    olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
 36.    olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
 37.    olcRootPW: secret
 38.    olcDbIndex: uid pres,eq
 39.    olcDbIndex: cn,sn pres,eq,approx,sub
 40.    olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
 41.    olcAccess: to attrs=userPassword
 42.      by self write
 43.      by anonymous auth
 44.      by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 45.      by * none
 46.    olcAccess: to *
 47.      by self write
 48.      by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 49.      by * read
 50.
```

Line 29 is a comment. Lines 30-33 identify this entry as a MDB  database configuration entry.  Line 34 specifies the DN suffix for  queries to pass to this database. Line 35 specifies the directory in  which the database files will live.

Lines 36 and 37 identify the database *super-user* entry and associated password. This entry is not subject to access control or size or time limit restrictions.

Lines 38 through 40 indicate the indices to maintain for various attributes.

Lines 41 through 49 specify access control for entries in this database. For all applicable entries, the `userPassword` attribute is writable by the entry itself and by the "admin" entry.  It may be used for authentication/authorization purposes, but is otherwise not readable. All other attributes are writable by the entry and the  "admin" entry, but may be read by all users (authenticated or not).

Line 50 is a blank line, indicating the end of this entry.

The next entry defines another MDB database. This one handles queries involving the `dc=example,dc=net` subtree but is managed by the same entity as the first database.  Note  that without line 60, the read access would be allowed due to the global access rule at line 19.

```
 51.    # MDB definition for example.net
 52.    dn: olcDatabase=mdb,cn=config
 53.    objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 54.    objectClass: olcMdbConfig
 55.    olcDatabase: mdb
 56.    olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=net
 57.    olcDbDirectory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data-net
 58.    olcRootDN: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
 59.    olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
 60.    olcAccess: to * by users read
```

------

## 5.4. Converting old style *slapd.conf*(5) file to *cn=config* format

Before converting to the *cn=config* format you should make  sure that the config backend is properly configured in your existing  config file. While the config backend is always present inside slapd, by default it is only accessible by its rootDN, and there are no default  credentials assigned so unless you explicitly configure a means to  authenticate to it, it will be unusable.

If you do not already have a `database config` section, add something like this to the end of `slapd.conf`

```
 database config
 rootpw VerySecret
```



------

**Note:** Since the config backend can be used to load  arbitrary code into the slapd process, it is extremely important to  carefully guard whatever credentials are used to access it. Since simple passwords are vulnerable to password guessing attacks, it is usually  better to omit the rootpw and only use SASL authentication for the  config rootDN.

------



An existing *slapd.conf*(5) file can be converted to the new format using *slaptest*(8) or any of the slap tools:

```
        slaptest -f /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d
```

Test that you can access entries under `cn=config` using the default *rootdn* and the *rootpw* configured above:

```
        ldapsearch -x -D cn=config -w VerySecret -b cn=config
```

You can then discard the old *slapd.conf*(5) file. Make sure to launch *slapd*(8) with the *-F* option to specify the configuration directory if you are not using the default directory path.



------

**Note:** When converting from the slapd.conf format to  slapd.d format, any included files will also be integrated into the  resulting configuration database.

------



------

## 5.5. Recovering from a broken configuration

If the server using *cn=config* does not start, either because the configuration does not represent the current version or because it  has been corrupted, these actions are available, in the order of  decreasing preference.

Make sure you have made a backup of the "broken" version before you attempt any of these:

### 5.5.1. Generate an ldif version of the configuration database and reload from that

Most of the time, the configuration can be parsed and a text version generated with *slapcat*(8):

```
 slapcat -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d -n0 -l extracted_config.ldif
```

After you have backed up and removed the old configuration database  contents, this output ldif can be hand-edited to adjust or remove the  offending entries and imported again:

```
 slapadd -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d -l updated_config.ldif
 slaptest -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d
```

### 5.5.2. Modify config in-place

If the configuration can be parsed and you know exactly what you need to do, you can use *slapmodify*(8) to effect the required changes directly:

```
 slapmodify -F /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d
 dn: ..., cn=config
 changetype: ...
 ...
```

### 5.5.3. Recover with plain back-ldif

If the configuration contains items that *slapd*(8) cannot process as a *cn=config* database at all, the last resort is to disable schema checking and  operate on it as a regular back-ldif database. This might cease to work  with future versions of OpenLDAP without notice, attempt this only when  all of the above fail.

First, create a directory to serve as the hosting DB and create the structure:

```
 mkdir ./recovery ./recovery/cn=recovery
 cp /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d/cn=config.ldif ./recovery/cn=recovery
 cp -r /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d/cn=config ./recovery/cn=recovery
```

Or, if you have already backed up your old configuration, you can symlink it into place:

```
 mkdir ./recovery
 ln -s /usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d ./recovery/cn=recovery
```

Next, create a trivial *slapd.conf*(5) to access the new database:

```
 database ldif
 suffix cn=recovery
 directory ./recovery/
```

Note the change of suffix, `cn=config` is hardcoded to correspond to an active config database, so we have to home it one level deeper - at `cn=config,cn=recovery`.

Now you can use *slapmodify*(8) to modify the database, it is most likely you will need to run with schema checking disabled:

```
 slapmodify -f ./recovery.conf -s
```

You can test the validity of your config with *slaptest*(8):

```
 slaptest -F ./recovery/cn=recovery
```

And generate a full ldif with *slapcat*(8):

```
 slapcat -F ./recovery/cn=recovery -n0
```

# 6. The slapd Configuration File

This chapter describes configuring *slapd*(8) via the *slapd.conf*(5) configuration file.  *slapd.conf*(5) has been deprecated and should only be used if your site requires one  of the backends that hasn't yet been updated to work with the newer *slapd-config*(5) system.  Configuring *slapd*(8) via *slapd-config*(5) is described in the previous chapter.

The *slapd.conf*(5) file is normally installed in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap` directory.  An alternate configuration file location can be specified via a command-line option to *slapd*(8).

------

## 6.1. Configuration File Format

The *slapd.conf*(5) file consists of three types of  configuration information: global, backend specific, and database  specific.  Global information is specified first, followed by  information associated with a particular backend type, which is then  followed by information associated with a particular database instance.  Global directives can be overridden in backend and/or database  directives, and backend directives can be overridden by database  directives.

Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a '`#`' character are ignored.  If a line begins with whitespace, it is considered a  continuation of the previous line (even if the previous line is a  comment).

The general format of slapd.conf is as follows:

```
        # global configuration directives
        <global config directives>

        # backend definition
        backend <typeA>
        <backend-specific directives>

        # first database definition & config directives
        database <typeA>
        <database-specific directives>

        # second database definition & config directives
        database <typeB>
        <database-specific directives>

        # second database definition & config directives
        database <typeA>
        <database-specific directives>

        # subsequent backend & database definitions & config directives
        ...
```

A configuration directive may take arguments.  If so, they are  separated by whitespace.  If an argument contains whitespace, the  argument should be enclosed in double quotes `"like this"`. If an argument contains a double quote or a backslash character ``\`', the character should be preceded by a backslash character ``\`'.

The distribution contains an example configuration file that will be installed in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap` directory. A number of files containing schema definitions (attribute types and object classes) are also provided in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema` directory.

------

## 6.2. Configuration File Directives

This section details commonly used configuration directives.  For a complete list, see the *slapd.conf*(5) manual page.  This section separates the configuration file directives  into global, backend-specific and data-specific categories, describing  each directive and its default value (if any), and giving an example of  its use.

### 6.2.1. Global Directives

Directives described in this section apply to all backends and  databases unless specifically overridden in a backend or database  definition.  Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown  in brackets `<>`.

#### 6.2.1.1. access to <what> [ by <who> [<accesslevel>] [<control>] ]+

This directive grants access (specified by <accesslevel>) to a  set of entries and/or attributes (specified by <what>) by one or  more requestors (specified by <who>).  See the [Access Control](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/access-control.html) section of this guide for basic usage.



------

**Note:** If no `access` directives are specified, the default access control policy, `access to * by * read`, allows all both authenticated and anonymous users read access.

------



####  6.2.1.2. attributetype <[RFC4512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt) Attribute Type Description>

This directive defines an attribute type. Please see the [Schema Specification](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html) chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.

#### 6.2.1.3. idletimeout <integer>

Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an idle client connection.  An idletimeout of 0, the default, disables this  feature.

#### 6.2.1.4. include <filename>

This directive specifies that slapd should read additional  configuration information from the given file before continuing with the next line of the current file. The included file should follow the  normal slapd config file format.  The file is commonly used to include  files containing schema specifications.



------

**Note:** You should be careful when using this directive - there is no small limit on the number of nested include directives, and no loop detection is done.

------



#### 6.2.1.5. loglevel <level>

This directive specifies the level at which log statements and  operation statistics should be sent to syslog (currently logged to the *syslogd*(8) `LOG_LOCAL4` facility). You must have configured OpenLDAP `--enable-debug` (the default) for this to work, except for the two statistics levels,  which are always enabled. Log levels may be specified as integers or by  keyword. Multiple log levels may be used and the levels are additive.  The possible values for <integer> are:

| **Level** | **Keyword**    | **Description**                                              |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -1        | any            | enable all debugging                                         |
| 0         |                | no debugging                                                 |
| 1         | (0x1 trace)    | trace function calls                                         |
| 2         | (0x2 packets)  | debug packet handling                                        |
| 4         | (0x4 args)     | heavy trace debugging                                        |
| 8         | (0x8 conns)    | connection management                                        |
| 16        | (0x10 BER)     | print out packets sent and received                          |
| 32        | (0x20 filter)  | search filter processing                                     |
| 64        | (0x40 config)  | configuration processing                                     |
| 128       | (0x80 ACL)     | access control list processing                               |
| 256       | (0x100 stats)  | stats log connections/operations/results                     |
| 512       | (0x200 stats2) | stats log entries sent                                       |
| 1024      | (0x400 shell)  | print communication with shell backends                      |
| 2048      | (0x800 parse)  | print entry parsing debugging                                |
| 16384     | (0x4000 sync)  | syncrepl consumer processing                                 |
| 32768     | (0x8000 none)  | only messages that get logged regardless of configured log level |

The desired log level can be input as a single integer that combines  the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal or in hexadecimal notation,  as a list of integers (that are ORed internally), or as a list of the  names that are shown between brackets, such that

```
                loglevel 129
                loglevel 0x81
                loglevel 128 1
                loglevel 0x80 0x1
                loglevel acl trace
```

are equivalent.

Examples:

```
 loglevel -1
```

This will enable all log levels.

```
 loglevel conns filter
```

Just log the connection and search filter processing.

```
 loglevel none
```

Log those messages that are logged regardless of the configured  loglevel. This differs from setting the log level to 0, when no logging  occurs. At least the `None` level is required to have high priority messages logged.

Default:

```
 loglevel stats
```

Basic stats logging is configured by default.

####  6.2.1.6. objectclass <[RFC4512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt) Object Class Description>

This directive defines an object class. Please see the [Schema Specification](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html) chapter for information regarding how to use this directive.

#### 6.2.1.7. referral <URI>

This directive specifies the referral to pass back when slapd cannot find a local database to handle a request.

Example:

```
        referral ldap://root.openldap.org
```

This will refer non-local queries to the global root LDAP server at  the OpenLDAP Project. Smart LDAP clients can re-ask their query at that  server, but note that most of these clients are only going to know how  to handle simple LDAP URLs that contain a host part and optionally a  distinguished name part.

#### 6.2.1.8. sizelimit <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.

Default:

```
        sizelimit 500
```

See the [Limits](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/limits.html) section of this guide and *slapd.conf*(5) for more details.

#### 6.2.1.9. timelimit <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will spend answering a search request. If a request is not  finished in this time, a result indicating an exceeded timelimit will be returned.

Default:

```
        timelimit 3600
```

See the [Limits](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/limits.html) section of this guide and *slapd.conf*(5) for more details.

### 6.2.2. General Backend Directives

Directives in this section apply only to the backend in which they  are defined. They are supported by every type of backend. Backend  directives apply to all databases instances of the same type and,  depending on the directive, may be overridden by database directives.

#### 6.2.2.1. backend <type>

This directive marks the beginning of a backend declaration. `<type>` should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 6.2.

| **Types**  | **Description**                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `asyncmet` | a       Asynchronous Metadirectory backend            |
| `config`   | Slapd configuration backend                           |
| `dnssrv`   | DNS SRV backend                                       |
| `ldap`     | Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Proxy) backend |
| `ldif`     | Lightweight Data Interchange Format backend           |
| `mdb`      | Memory-Mapped DB backend                              |
| `meta`     | Metadirectory backend                                 |
| `monitor`  | Monitor backend                                       |
| `null`     | Null backend                                          |
| `passwd`   | Provides read-only access to *passwd*(5)              |
| `perl`     | Perl Programmable backend                             |
| `relay`    | Relay backend                                         |
| `sock`     | Socket backend                                        |
| `sql`      | SQL Programmable backend                              |
| `wt`       | WiredTiger backend                                    |

Example:

```
        backend mdb
        idlexp 16
```

This marks the beginning of a new MDB backend  definition. At present, only back-mdb implements any options of this  type, so this setting is not needed for any other backends.

### 6.2.3. General Database Directives

Directives in this section apply only to the database in which they are defined. They are supported by every type of database.

#### 6.2.3.1. database <type>

This directive marks the beginning of a database instance declaration. `<type>` should be one of the supported backend types listed in Table 6.2.

Example:

```
        database mdb
```

This marks the beginning of a new MDB database instance declaration.

#### 6.2.3.2. limits <selector> <limit> [<limit> [...]]

Specify time and size limits based on the operation's initiator or base DN.

See the [Limits](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/limits.html) section of this guide and *slapd.conf*(5) for more details.

#### 6.2.3.3. readonly { on | off }

This directive puts the database into "read-only" mode. Any attempts  to modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.  If  set on a consumer, modifications sent by syncrepl will still occur.

Default:

```
        readonly off
```

#### 6.2.3.4. rootdn <DN>

This directive specifies the DN that is not subject to access control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database.   The DN need not refer to an entry in this database or even in the  directory. The DN may refer to a SASL identity.

Entry-based Example:

```
        rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
```

SASL-based Example:

```
        rootdn "uid=root,cn=example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth"
```

See the [SASL Authentication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#SASL Authentication) section for information on SASL authentication identities.

#### 6.2.3.5. rootpw <password>

This directive can be used to specifies a password for the DN for the rootdn (when the rootdn is set to a DN within the database).

Example:

```
        rootpw secret
```

It is also permissible to provide hash of the password in [RFC2307](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt) form.  *slappasswd*(8) may be used to generate the password hash.

Example:

```
        rootpw {SSHA}ZKKuqbEKJfKSXhUbHG3fG8MDn9j1v4QN
```

The hash was generated using the command `slappasswd -s secret`.

#### 6.2.3.6. suffix <dn suffix>

This directive specifies the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend database. Multiple suffix lines can be given, and at  least one is required for each database definition.

Example:

```
        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
```

Queries with a DN ending in "dc=example,dc=com" will be passed to this backend.



------

**Note:** When the backend to pass a query to is selected,  slapd looks at the suffix line(s) in each database definition in the  order they appear in the file. Thus, if one database suffix is a prefix  of another, it must appear after it in the config file.

------



#### 6.2.3.7. syncrepl

```

```

This directive specifies the current database as a consumer of the provider content by establishing the current *slapd*(8) as a replication consumer site running a syncrepl replication engine.  The provider database is located at the replication provider site  specified by the `provider` parameter. The consumer database is  kept up-to-date with the provider content using the LDAP Content  Synchronization protocol. See [RFC4533](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt) for more information on the protocol.

The `rid` parameter is used for identification of the current `syncrepl` directive within the replication consumer server, where `<replica ID>` uniquely identifies the syncrepl specification described by the current `syncrepl` directive. `<replica ID>` is non-negative and is no more than three decimal digits in length.

The `provider` parameter specifies the replication provider site containing the provider content as an LDAP URI. The `provider` parameter specifies a scheme, a host and optionally a port where the  provider slapd instance can be found. Either a domain name or IP address may be used for <hostname>. Examples are `ldap://provider.example.com:389` or `ldaps://192.168.1.1:636`. If <port> is not given, the standard LDAP port number (389 or  636) is used. Note that the syncrepl uses a consumer-initiated protocol, and hence its specification is located on the consumer.

The content of the syncrepl consumer is defined using a search  specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send search  requests to the provider slapd according to the search specification.  The search specification includes `searchbase`, `scope`, `filter`, `attrs`, `exattrs`, `attrsonly`, `sizelimit`, and `timelimit` parameters as in the normal search specification. The `searchbase` parameter has no default value and must always be specified. The `scope` defaults to `sub`, the `filter` defaults to `(objectclass=*)`, `attrs` defaults to `"*,+"` to replicate all user and operational attributes, and `attrsonly` is unset by default. Both `sizelimit` and `timelimit` default to "unlimited", and only positive integers or "unlimited" may be specified. The `exattrs` option may also be used to specify attributes that should be omitted from incoming entries.

The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types: `refreshOnly` and `refreshAndPersist`. The operation type is specified by the `type` parameter. In the `refreshOnly` operation, the next synchronization search operation is periodically  rescheduled at an interval time after each synchronization operation  finishes. The interval is specified by the `interval` parameter. It is set to one day by default. In the `refreshAndPersist` operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the provider *slapd* instance. Further updates to the provider will generate `searchResultEntry` to the consumer slapd as the search responses to the persistent synchronization search.

If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt to  reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of the  <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs. For example,  retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for the  first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next three times before stop retrying. + in <#  of retries> means indefinite  number of retries until success.

The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site by turning on the `schemachecking` parameter. If it is turned on, every replicated entry will be checked  for its schema as the entry is stored on the consumer. Every entry in  the consumer should contain those attributes required by the schema  definition. If it is turned off, entries will be stored without checking schema conformance. The default is off.

The `network-timeout` parameter sets how long the consumer  will wait to establish a network connection to the provider.  Once a  connection is established, the `timeout` parameter determines how long the consumer will wait for the initial Bind request to complete.   The defaults for these parameters come from *ldap.conf*(5).

The `binddn` parameter gives the DN to bind as for the  syncrepl searches to the provider slapd. It should be a DN which has  read access to the replication content in the provider database.

The `bindmethod` is `simple` or `sasl`, depending on whether simple password-based authentication or SASL authentication is to be used when connecting to the provider *slapd* instance.

Simple authentication should not be used unless adequate data  integrity and confidentiality protections are in place (e.g. TLS or  IPsec). Simple authentication requires specification of `binddn` and `credentials` parameters.

SASL authentication is generally recommended.  SASL authentication requires specification of a mechanism using the `saslmech` parameter. Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity and/or credentials can be specified using `authcid` and `credentials`, respectively.  The `authzid` parameter may be used to specify an authorization identity.

The `realm` parameter specifies a realm which a certain mechanisms authenticate the identity within. The `secprops` parameter specifies Cyrus SASL security properties.

The `keepalive` parameter sets the values of idle, probes, and interval used to check whether a socket is alive;  idle is the number  of seconds a connection needs to remain idle before TCP starts sending  keepalive probes; probes is the maximum number of keepalive probes TCP  should send before dropping the connection; interval is interval in  seconds between individual keepalive probes.  Only some systems support  the customization of these values; the keepalive parameter is ignored  otherwise, and system-wide settings are used. For example,  keepalive="240:10:30" will send a keepalive probe 10 times, every 30  seconds, after 240 seconds of idle activity.  If no response to the  probes is received, the connection will be dropped.

The `starttls` parameter specifies use of the StartTLS  extended operation to establish a TLS session before authenticating to  the provider. If the `critical` argument is supplied, the session will be aborted if the StartTLS request fails.  Otherwise the syncrepl  session continues without TLS.  The tls_reqcert setting defaults to `"demand"` and the other TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings.

The `suffixmassage` parameter allows the consumer to pull  entries from a remote directory whose DN suffix differs from the local  directory. The portion of the remote entries' DNs that matches the  searchbase will be replaced with the suffixmassage DN.

Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs of data modifications.  This mode of operation is referred to as *delta syncrepl*.  In addition to the above parameters, the `logbase` and `logfilter` parameters must be set appropriately for the log that will be used. The `syncdata` parameter must be set to either `"accesslog"` if the log conforms to the *slapo-accesslog*(5) log format, or `"changelog"` if the log conforms to the obsolete *changelog* format. If the `syncdata` parameter is omitted or set to `"default"` then the log parameters are ignored.

The *syncrepl* replication mechanism is supported by the *mdb* backend.

See the [LDAP Sync Replication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#LDAP Sync Replication) chapter of this guide for more information on how to use this directive.

#### 6.2.3.8. updateref <URL>

This directive is only applicable in a *replica* (or *shadow*) *slapd*(8) instance. It specifies the URL to return to clients which submit update requests upon the replica. If specified multiple times, each URL is provided.

Example:

```
        updateref       ldap://provider.example.net
```

### 6.2.4. MDB Backend Directives

Directives in this category only apply to the MDB  database backend. They will apply to all "database mdb" instances in the configuration. For a complete reference of MDB backend configuration  directives, see *slapd-mdb*(5).

#### 6.2.4.1. idlexp <exponent>

Specify a power of 2 for the maximum size of an index slot. The  default is 16, yielding a maximum slot size of 2^16 or 65536. The  specified value must be in the range of 16-30.

This setting helps with the case where certain search filters are  slow to return results due to an index slot having collapsed to a range  value.  This occurs when the number of candidate entries that match the  filter for the index slot exceed the configured slot size.

If this setting is decreased on a server with existing MDB databases, each db will immediately need its indices to be rebuilt while slapd is offline with the "slapindex -q -t" command.

If this setting is increased on a server with existing MDB databases, each db will need its indices rebuilt to take advantage of  the change for indices that have already been converted to ranges.

### 6.2.5. MDB Database Directives

Directives in this category only apply to the MDB  database backend. That is, they must follow a "database mdb" line and  come before any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines. For a complete reference of MDB configuration directives, see *slapd-mdb*(5).

#### 6.2.5.1. directory <directory>

This directive specifies the directory where the MDB files containing the database and associated indices live.

Default:

```
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
```

#### 6.2.5.2. checkpoint <kbyte> <min>

This directive specifies the frequency for flushing the database disk buffers. This directive is only needed if the *dbnosync* option is `TRUE`. The checkpoint will occur if either <kbyte> data has been written or <min> minutes have passed since the last checkpoint. Both  arguments default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When the  <min> argument is non-zero, an internal task will run every  <min> minutes to perform the checkpoint. Note: currently the  _kbyte_ setting is unimplemented.

Example:

```
   checkpoint: 1024 10
```

#### 6.2.5.3. dbnosync: { TRUE | FALSE }

This directive causes on-disk database contents to not be immediately synchronized with in memory changes upon change.  Setting this option  to `TRUE` may improve performance at the expense of data integrity.

#### 6.2.5.4. envflags: {nosync,nometasync,writemap,mapasync,nordahead}

This option specifies flags for finer-grained control of  the  LMDB  library's operation.

- `nosync`: This is exactly the same as the dbnosync directive.
- `nometasync`: Flush the data on a commit, but skip the  sync of the meta page. This mode is slightly faster than doing a full  sync, but can potentially lose the last committed transaction if the  operating system crashes. If both nometasync and nosync are set, the  nosync flag takes precedence.
- `writemap`: Use a writable memory map instead of just  read-only. This speeds up write operations but makes the database  vulnerable to corruption in case any bugs in slapd cause stray writes  into the mmap region.
- `mapasync`: When using a writable memory map and  performing flushes on each commit, use an asynchronous flush instead of a synchronous flush (the default). This option has no effect if writemap  has not been set. It also has no effect if nosync is set.
- `nordahead`: Turn off file readahead. Usually the OS  performs readahead on every read request. This usually boosts read  performance but can be harmful to random access read performance if the  system's memory is full and the DB is larger than RAM. This option is  not implemented on Windows.

#### 6.2.5.5. index: {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]

This directive specifies the indices to maintain for the given attribute. If only an `<attrlist>` is given, the default indices are maintained. The index keywords  correspond to the common types of matches that may be used in an LDAP  search filter.

Example:

```
   index: default pres,eq
   index: uid
   index: cn,sn pres,eq,sub
   index: objectClass eq
```

The first line sets the default set of indices to maintain to present and equality.  The second line causes the default (pres,eq) set of  indices to be maintained for the `uid` attribute type. The third line causes present, equality, and substring indices to be maintained for `cn` and `sn` attribute types.  The fourth line causes an equality index for the `objectClass` attribute type.

There is no index keyword for inequality matches. Generally these  matches do not use an index. However, some attributes do support  indexing for inequality matches, based on the equality index.

A substring index can be more explicitly specified as `subinitial`, `subany`, or `subfinal`, corresponding to the three possible components of a substring match  filter. A subinitial index only indexes substrings that appear at the  beginning of an attribute value. A subfinal index only indexes  substrings that appear at the end of an attribute value, while subany  indexes substrings that occur anywhere in a value.

Note that by default, setting an index for an attribute also affects  every subtype of that attribute. E.g., setting an equality index on the `name` attribute causes `cn`, `sn`, and every other attribute that inherits from `name` to be indexed.

By default, no indices are maintained.  It is generally advised that minimally an equality index upon objectClass be maintained.

```
   index: objectClass eq
```

Additional indices should be configured corresponding to the most  common searches that are used on the database. Presence indexing should  not be configured for an attribute unless the attribute occurs very  rarely in the database, and presence searches on the attribute occur  very frequently during normal use of the directory. Most applications  don't use presence searches, so usually presence indexing is not very  useful.

#### 6.2.5.6. maxentrysize: <bytes>

Specify the maximum size of an entry in bytes. Attempts to store an  entry larger than this size will be rejected with the error  LDAP_ADMINLIMIT_EXCEEDED. The default is 0, which is unlimited.

#### 6.2.5.7. maxreaders: <integer>

This directive specifies the maximum number of threads that may have  concurrent read access to the database. Tools such as slapcat count as a single thread, in addition to threads in any active slapd processes.  The default is 126.

#### 6.2.5.8. maxsize: <bytes>

This directive specifies the maximum size of the database in bytes. A memory map of this size is allocated at startup time and the database  will not be allowed to grow beyond this size. The default is 10485760  bytes (10MB). This setting may be changed upward if the configured limit needs to be increased.



------

**Note:** It is important to set this to as large a value  as possible, (relative to anticipated growth of the actual data over  time) since growing the size later may not be practical when the system  is under heavy load.

------



#### 6.2.5.9. mode: { <octal> | <symbolic> }

This directive specifies the file protection mode that newly created database index files should have. This can be in the form `0600` or `-rw-------`

Default:

```
   mode: 0600
```

#### 6.2.5.10. multival: { <attrlist> | default } <integer> hi,<integer> lo

Specify the number of values for which a multivalued attribute is  stored in a separate table. Normally entries are stored as a single blob inside the database. When an entry gets very large or contains  attributes with a very large number of values, modifications on that  entry may get very slow. Splitting the large attributes out to a  separate table can improve the performance of modification operations.  The threshold is specified as a pair of integers. If the number of  values exceeds the hi threshold the values will be split out. If a  modification deletes enough values to bring an attribute below the lo  threshold the values will be removed from the separate table and merged  back into the main entry blob. The threshold can be set for a specific  list of attributes, or the default can be configured for all other  attributes. The default value for both hi and lo thresholds is UINT_MAX, which keeps all attributes in the main blob.

In addition to increasing write performance of operations the use of multival can also decrease fragmentation of the primary MDB database.

#### 6.2.5.11. rtxnsize: <entries>

This directive specifies the maximum number of entries to process in a single read transaction when executing a large search. Long-lived read  transactions prevent old database pages from being reused in write  transactions, and so can cause significant growth of the database file  when there is heavy write traffic. This setting causes the read  transaction in large searches to be released and reacquired after the  given number of entries has been read, to give writers the opportunity  to reclaim old database pages. The default is 10000.

#### 6.2.5.12. searchstack: <integer>

Specify the depth of the stack used for search filter evaluation. Search filters are evaluated on a stack to accommodate nested `AND` / `OR` clauses. An individual stack is allocated for each server thread. The  depth of the stack determines how complex a filter can be evaluated  without requiring any additional memory allocation. Filters that are  nested deeper than the search stack depth will cause a separate stack to be allocated for that particular search operation. These separate  allocations can have a major negative impact on server performance, but  specifying too much stack will also consume a great deal of memory. Each search uses 512K bytes per level on a 32-bit machine, or 1024K bytes  per level on a 64-bit machine. The default stack depth is 16, thus 8MB  or 16MB per thread is used on 32 and 64 bit machines, respectively. Also the 512KB size of a single stack slot is set by a compile-time constant which may be changed if needed; the code must be recompiled for the  change to take effect.

Default:

```
   searchstack: 16
```

#### 6.2.5.13. Sample Entry

```
database mdb
suffix: "dc=example,dc=com"
directory: /usr/local/var/openldap-data
index: objectClass eq
```

------

## 6.3. Configuration File Example

The following is an example configuration file, interspersed with  explanatory text. It defines two databases to handle different parts of  the X.500 tree; both are MDB database  instances. The line numbers shown are provided for reference only and  are not included in the actual file. First, the global configuration  section:

```
  1.    # example config file - global configuration section
  2.    include /usr/local/etc/schema/core.schema
  3.    referral ldap://root.openldap.org
  4.    access to * by * read
```

Line 1 is a comment. Line 2 includes another config file which contains *core* schema definitions. The `referral` directive on line 3 means that queries not local to one of the  databases defined below will be referred to the LDAP server running on  the standard port (389) at the host `root.openldap.org`.

Line 4 is a global access control.  It applies to all entries (after any applicable database-specific access controls).

The next section of the configuration file defines a MDB backend that will handle queries for things in the "dc=example,dc=com" portion of  the tree. The database is to be replicated to two replica slapds, one on truelies, the other on judgmentday. Indices are to be maintained for  several attributes, and the `userPassword` attribute is to be protected from unauthorized access.

```
  5.    # MDB definition for the example.com
  6.    database mdb
  7.    suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
  8.    directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
  9.    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 10.    rootpw secret
 11.    # indexed attribute definitions
 12.    index uid pres,eq
 13.    index cn,sn pres,eq,approx,sub
 14.    index objectClass eq
 15.    # database access control definitions
 16.    access to attrs=userPassword
 17.        by self write
 18.        by anonymous auth
 19.        by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 20.        by * none
 21.    access to *
 22.        by self write
 23.        by dn.base="cn=Admin,dc=example,dc=com" write
 24.        by * read
```

Line 5 is a comment. The start of the database definition is marked  by the database keyword on line 6. Line 7 specifies the DN suffix for  queries to pass to this database. Line 8 specifies the directory in  which the database files will live.

Lines 9 and 10 identify the database *super-user* entry and associated password. This entry is not subject to access control or size or time limit restrictions.

Lines 12 through 14 indicate the indices to maintain for various attributes.

Lines 16 through 24 specify access control for entries in this database. For all applicable entries, the `userPassword` attribute is writable by the entry itself and by the "admin" entry.  It may be used for authentication/authorization purposes, but is otherwise not readable. All other attributes are writable by the entry and the  "admin" entry, but may be read by all users (authenticated or not).

The next section of the example configuration file defines another MDB database. This one handles queries involving the `dc=example,dc=net` subtree but is managed by the same entity as the first database.  Note  that without line 39, the read access would be allowed due to the global access rule at line 4.

```
 33.    # MDB definition for example.net
 34.    database mdb
 35.    suffix "dc=example,dc=net"
 36.    directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data-net
 37.    rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
 38.    index objectClass eq
 39.    access to * by users read
```

# 7. Running slapd

*slapd*(8) is designed to be run as a standalone service.   This allows the server to take advantage of caching, manage concurrency  issues with underlying databases, and conserve system resources. Running from *inetd*(8) is *NOT* an option.

------

## 7.1. Command-Line Options

*slapd*(8) supports a number of command-line options as detailed in the manual page.  This section details a few commonly used options.

```
        -f <filename>
```

This option specifies an alternate configuration file for slapd. The default is normally `/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf`.

```
        -F <slapd-config-directory>
```

Specifies the slapd configuration directory. The default is `/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.d`.

If both `-f` and `-F` are specified, the config file  will be read and converted to config directory format and written to the specified directory. If neither option is specified, slapd will attempt to read the default config directory before trying to use the default  config file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config  file is ignored. All of the slap tools that use the config options  observe this same behavior.

```
        -h <URLs>
```

This option specifies alternative listener configurations.  The default is `ldap:///` which implies LDAP over TCP on all interfaces on the default LDAP port 389.  You can specify specific host-port pairs or other protocol schemes (such as `ldaps://` or `ldapi://`). slapd supports the HAProxy proxy protocol version 2, which allows a  load balancer or proxy server to provide the remote client IP address to slapd to be used for access control or logging. Listeners configured  using either `pldap:///` or `pldaps:///` URLS will only  accept connections that include the necessary proxy protocol header.  Connections to the ports used by these listeners should be restricted at the network level to only trusted load balancers or proxies to avoid  spoofing of client IP addresses by third parties.

| **URL**    | **Protocol**          | **Transport**            |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ldap:///   | LDAP                  | TCP port 389             |
| pldap:///  | proxied LDAP          | TCP port 389             |
| ldaps:///  | LDAP over SSL         | TCP port 636             |
| pldaps:/// | proxied LDAP over SSL | TCP port 636             |
| ldapi:///  | LDAP                  | IPC (Unix-domain socket) |

For example, `-h "ldaps:// ldap://127.0.0.1:666"` will create two listeners: one for the (non-standard) `ldaps://` scheme on all interfaces on the default `ldaps://` port 636, and one for the standard `ldap://` scheme on the `localhost` (*loopback*) interface on port 666.  Hosts may be specified using using hostnames or IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Port values must be numeric.

For LDAP over IPC, the pathname of the Unix-domain socket can be  encoded in the URL. Note that directory separators must be URL-encoded,  like any other characters that are special to URLs. Thus the socket `/usr/local/var/ldapi` must be encoded as

```
        ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi
```

ldapi: is described in detail in *Using LDAP Over IPC Mechanisms* [[Chu-LDAPI](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-chu-ldap-ldapi-00)]

Note that the ldapi:/// transport is not widely implemented: non-OpenLDAP clients may not be able to use it.

```
        -n <service-name>
```

This option specifies the service name used for logging and other purposes. The default service name is `slapd`.

```
        -l <syslog-local-user>
```

This option specifies the local user for the *syslog*(8) facility.  Values can be `LOCAL0`, `LOCAL1`, `LOCAL2`, ..., and `LOCAL7`.  The default is `LOCAL4`.  This option may not be supported on all systems.

```
        -u user -g group
```

These options specify the user and group, respectively, to run as.  `user` can be either a user name or uid.  `group` can be either a group name or gid.

```
        -r directory
```

This option specifies a run-time directory.  slapd will *chroot*(2) to this directory after opening listeners but before reading any configuration files or initializing any backends.



```
        -d <level> | ?
```

This option sets the slapd debug level to <level>. When level  is a `?' character, the various debugging levels are printed and slapd  exits, regardless of any other options you give it. Current debugging  levels are

| **Level** | **Keyword**    | **Description**                                         |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| -1        | any            | enable all debugging                                    |
| 0         |                | no debugging                                            |
| 1         | (0x1 trace)    | trace function calls                                    |
| 2         | (0x2 packets)  | debug packet handling                                   |
| 4         | (0x4 args)     | heavy trace debugging                                   |

| 32768     | (0x8000 none)  | only messages that get logged whatever log level is set |

You may enable multiple levels by specifying the debug option once  for each desired level.  Or, since debugging levels are additive, you  can do the math yourself. That is, if you want to trace function calls  and watch the config file being processed, you could set level to the  sum of those two levels (in this case, ` -d 65`).  Or, you can let slapd do the math, (e.g. ` -d 1 -d 64`).  Consult `<ldap_log.h>` for more details.



------

**Note:** slapd must have been compiled with `--enable-debug`, which is the default, for any debugging information other than the stats and stats2 levels to be available as options.

------



------

## 7.2. Starting slapd

In general, slapd is run like this:

```
        /usr/local/libexec/slapd [<option>]*
```

where `/usr/local/libexec` is determined by `configure` and <option> is one of the options described above (or in *slapd*(8)). Unless you have specified a debugging level (including level `0`), slapd will automatically fork and detach itself from its controlling terminal and run in the background.

------

## 7.3. Stopping slapd

To kill off *slapd*(8) safely, you should give a command like this

```
        kill -INT `cat /usr/local/var/slapd.pid`
```

where `/usr/local/var` is determined by `configure`.

Killing slapd by a more drastic method may cause information loss or database corruption.

# 8. Access Control

------

## 8.1. Introduction

As the directory gets populated with more and more data of varying  sensitivity, controlling the kinds of access granted to the directory  becomes more and more critical. For instance, the directory may contain  data of a confidential nature that you may need to protect by contract  or by law. Or, if using the directory to control access to other  services, inappropriate access to the directory may create avenues of  attack to your sites security that result in devastating damage to your  assets.

Access to your directory can be configured via two methods, the first using [The slapd Configuration File](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html) and the second using the *slapd-config*(5) format ([Configuring slapd](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconf2.html)).

The default access control policy is allow read by all clients. Regardless of what access control policy is defined, the *rootdn* is always allowed full rights (i.e. auth, search, compare, read and write) on everything and anything.

As a consequence, it's useless (and results in a performance penalty) to explicitly list the *rootdn* among the *<by>* clauses.

The following sections will describe Access Control Lists in greater  depth and follow with some examples and recommendations. See *slapd.access*(5) for complete details.

------

## 8.2. Access Control via Static Configuration

Access to entries and attributes is controlled by the access  configuration file directive. The general form of an access line is:

```
    <access directive> ::= access to <what>
        [by <who> [<access>] [<control>] ]+
    <what> ::= * |
        [dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [filter=<ldapfilter>] [attrs=<attrlist>]
    <basic-style> ::= regex | exact
    <scope-style> ::= base | one | subtree | children
    <attrlist> ::= <attr> [val[.<basic-style>]=<regex>] | <attr> , <attrlist>
    <attr> ::= <attrname> | entry | children
    <who> ::= * | [anonymous | users | self
            | dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [dnattr=<attrname>]
        [group[/<objectclass>[/<attrname>][.<basic-style>]]=<regex>]
        [peername[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockname[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [domain[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockurl[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [set=<setspec>]
        [aci=<attrname>]
    <access> ::= [self]{<level>|<priv>}
    <level> ::= none | disclose | auth | compare | search | read | write | manage
    <priv> ::= {=|+|-}{m|w|r|s|c|x|d|0}+
    <control> ::= [stop | continue | break]
```

where the <what> part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the `<who>` part specifies which entities are granted access, and the `<access>` part specifies the access granted. Multiple `<who> <access> <control>` triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different  access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these  access control options are described here; for more details see the *slapd.access*(5) man page.

### 8.2.1. What to control access to

The <what> part of an access specification determines the  entries and attributes to which the access control applies.  Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter.  The following  qualifiers select entries by DN:

```
    to *
    to dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>
    to dn.<scope-style>=<DN>
```

The first form is used to select all entries.  The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the  target entry's *normalized DN*.   (The second form is not  discussed further in this document.)  The third form is used to select  entries which are within the requested scope of DN.  The <DN> is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in [RFC4514](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt).

The scope can be either `base`, `one`, `subtree`, or `children`.  Where `base` matches only the entry with provided DN, `one` matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, `subtree` matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and `children` matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).

For example, if the directory contained entries named:

```
    0: o=suffix
    1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
    2: ou=people,o=suffix
    3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix
```

Then:

`dn.base="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 2;   `dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 3, and 5;   `dn.subtree="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and   `dn.children="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 3, 4, and 5.

Entries may also be selected using a filter:

```
    to filter=<ldap filter>
```

where <ldap filter> is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in [RFC4515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4515.txt).  For example:

```
    to filter=(objectClass=person)
```

Note that entries may be selected by both DN and filter by including both qualifiers in the <what> clause.

```
    to dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" filter=(objectClass=person)
```

Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the <what> selector:

```
    attrs=<attribute list>
```

A specific value of an attribute is selected by using a single attribute name and also using a value selector:

```
    attrs=<attribute> val[.<style>]=<regex>
```

There are two special *pseudo* attributes `entry` and `children`.  To read (and hence return) a target entry, the subject must have `read` access to the target's *entry* attribute.  To perform a search, the subject must have `search` access to the search base's *entry* attribute. To add or delete an entry, the subject must have `write` access to the entry's `entry` attribute AND must have `write` access to the entry's parent's `children` attribute.  To rename an entry, the subject must have `write` access to entry's `entry` attribute AND have `write` access to both the old parent's and new parent's `children` attributes.  The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.

Lastly, there is a special entry selector `"*"` that is used to select any entry.  It is used when no other `<what>` selector has been provided.  It's equivalent to "`dn=.*`"

### 8.2.2. Who to grant access to

The <who> part identifies the entity or entities being granted  access. Note that access is granted to "entities" not "entries." The  following table summarizes entity specifiers:

| **Specifier**                | **Entities**                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`                          | All, including anonymous and authenticated users |
| `anonymous`                  | Anonymous (non-authenticated) users              |
| `users`                      | Authenticated users                              |
| `self`                       | User associated with target entry                |
| `dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>` | Users matching a regular expression              |
| `dn.<scope-style>=<DN>`      | Users within scope of a DN                       |

The DN specifier behaves much like <what> clause DN specifiers.

Other control factors are also supported.  For example, a `<who>` can be restricted by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:

```
    dnattr=<dn-valued attribute name>
```

The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN  is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group  entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).

Some factors may not be appropriate in all environments (or any). For example, the domain factor relies on IP to domain name lookups. As  these can easily be spoofed, the domain factor should be avoided.

### 8.2.3. The access to grant

The kind of <access> granted can be one of the following:

| **Level**       | **Privileges** | **Description**                            |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `none        =` | `0`            | no access                                  |
| `disclose    =` | `d`            | needed for information disclosure on error |
| `auth        =` | `dx`           | needed to authenticate (bind)              |
| `compare     =` | `cdx`          | needed to compare                          |
| `search      =` | `scdx`         | needed to apply search filters             |
| `read        =` | `rscdx`        | needed to read search results              |
| `write       =` | `wrscdx`       | needed to modify/rename                    |
| `manage      =` | `mwrscdx`      | needed to manage                           |

Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone `write` access to an entry also grants them `read`, `search`, `compare`, `auth` and `disclose` access.  However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.

### 8.2.4. Access Control Evaluation

When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an  entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the `<what>` selectors given in the configuration file. For  each entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the  entry (or the global access directives if not held in any database)  apply first, followed by the global access directives. However, when  dealing with an access list, because the global access list is  effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit `access to * by * none` directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

Within this priority, access directives are examined in the order in  which they appear in the config file.  Slapd stops with the first `<what>` selector that matches the entry and/or attribute. The corresponding  access directive is the one slapd will use to evaluate access.

Next, slapd compares the entity requesting access to the `<who>` selectors within the access directive selected above in the order in which they appear. It stops with the first `<who>` selector that matches the requester. This determines the access the entity requesting access has to the entry and/or attribute.

Finally, slapd compares the access granted in the selected `<access>` clause to the access requested by the client. If it allows greater or  equal access, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.

The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more  specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should  appear first in the config file. Similarly, if one `<who>`  selector is more specific than another it should come first in the  access directive. The access control examples given below should help  make this clear.

### 8.2.5. Access Control Examples

The access control facility described above is quite powerful.  This  section shows some examples of its use for descriptive purposes.

A simple example:

```
    access to * by * read
```

This access directive grants read access to everyone.

```
    access to *
        by self write
        by anonymous auth
        by * read
```

This directive allows the user to modify their entry, allows  anonymous to authenticate against these entries, and allows all others  to read these entries.  Note that only the first `by <who>` clause which matches applies.  Hence, the anonymous users are granted `auth`, not `read`.  The last clause could just as well have been "`by users read`".

It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of  protection in place.  The following shows how security strength factors  (SSF) can be used.

```
    access to *
        by ssf=128 self write
        by ssf=64 anonymous auth
        by ssf=64 users read
```

This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security  protections of strength 128 or better have been established, allows  authentication access to anonymous users, and read access when 64 or  better security protections have been established.  If a client has not  established sufficient security protections, the implicit `by * none` clause would be applied.

The following example shows the use of a style specifiers to select  the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is  significant.

```
    access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    access to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read
```

Read access is granted to entries under the `dc=com` subtree, except for those entries under the `dc=example,dc=com` subtree, to which search access is granted.  No access is granted to `dc=com` as neither access directive matches this DN.  If the order of these  access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be  reached, since all entries under `dc=example,dc=com` are also under `dc=com` entries.

Also note that if no `access to` directive matches or no `by <who>` clause, **access is denied**.  That is, every `access to` directive ends with an implicit `by * none` clause. When dealing with an access list, because the global access  list is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit `access to * by * none` directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the `by <who>` clauses.  It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various `<who>` selectors.

```
    access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=homePhone
        by self write
        by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
        by peername.regex=IP=10\..+ read
    access to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
        by self write
        by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
        by anonymous auth
```

This example applies to entries in the "`dc=example,dc=com`" subtree. To all attributes except `homePhone`, an entry can write to itself, entries under `example.com` entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit `by * none`) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously).  The `homePhone` attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under `example.com`, readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable (implicit `by * none`).  All other access is denied by the implicit `access to * by * none`.

Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove  itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a  group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the  member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like  this:

```
    access to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
```

The dnattr `<who>` selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the `member` attribute. The `selfwrite` access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry  attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access  any of the entry's attributes.

------

## 8.3. Access Control via Dynamic Configuration

Access to slapd entries and attributes is controlled by the olcAccess attribute, whose values are a sequence of access directives. The  general form of the olcAccess configuration is:

```
    olcAccess: <access directive>
    <access directive> ::= to <what>
        [by <who> [<access>] [<control>] ]+
    <what> ::= * |
        [dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [filter=<ldapfilter>] [attrs=<attrlist>]
    <basic-style> ::= regex | exact
    <scope-style> ::= base | one | subtree | children
    <attrlist> ::= <attr> [val[.<basic-style>]=<regex>] | <attr> , <attrlist>
    <attr> ::= <attrname> | entry | children
    <who> ::= * | [anonymous | users | self
            | dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex> | dn.<scope-style>=<DN>]
        [dnattr=<attrname>]
        [group[/<objectclass>[/<attrname>][.<basic-style>]]=<regex>]
        [peername[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockname[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [domain[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [sockurl[.<basic-style>]=<regex>]
        [set=<setspec>]
        [aci=<attrname>]
    <access> ::= [self]{<level>|<priv>}
    <level> ::= none | disclose | auth | compare | search | read | write | manage
    <priv> ::= {=|+|-}{m|w|r|s|c|x|d|0}+
    <control> ::= [stop | continue | break]
```

where the <what> part selects the entries and/or attributes to which the access applies, the `<who>` part specifies which entities are granted access, and the `<access>` part specifies the access granted. Multiple `<who> <access> <control>` triplets are supported, allowing many entities to be granted different  access to the same set of entries and attributes. Not all of these  access control options are described here; for more details see the *slapd.access*(5) man page.

### 8.3.1. What to control access to

The <what> part of an access specification determines the  entries and attributes to which the access control applies.  Entries are commonly selected in two ways: by DN and by filter.  The following  qualifiers select entries by DN:

```
    to *
    to dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>
    to dn.<scope-style>=<DN>
```

The first form is used to select all entries.  The second form may be used to select entries by matching a regular expression against the  target entry's *normalized DN*.   (The second form is not  discussed further in this document.)  The third form is used to select  entries which are within the requested scope of DN.  The <DN> is a string representation of the Distinguished Name, as described in [RFC4514](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt).

The scope can be either `base`, `one`, `subtree`, or `children`.  Where `base` matches only the entry with provided DN, `one` matches the entries whose parent is the provided DN, `subtree` matches all entries in the subtree whose root is the provided DN, and `children` matches all entries under the DN (but not the entry named by the DN).

For example, if the directory contained entries named:

```
    0: o=suffix
    1: cn=Manager,o=suffix
    2: ou=people,o=suffix
    3: uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    4: cn=addresses,uid=kdz,ou=people,o=suffix
    5: uid=hyc,ou=people,o=suffix
```

Then:

`dn.base="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 2;   `dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 3, and 5;   `dn.subtree="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 2, 3, 4, and 5; and   `dn.children="ou=people,o=suffix"` match 3, 4, and 5.

Entries may also be selected using a filter:

```
    to filter=<ldap filter>
```

where <ldap filter> is a string representation of an LDAP search filter, as described in [RFC4515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4515.txt).  For example:

```
    to filter=(objectClass=person)
```

Note that entries may be selected by both DN and filter by including both qualifiers in the <what> clause.

```
    to dn.one="ou=people,o=suffix" filter=(objectClass=person)
```

Attributes within an entry are selected by including a comma-separated list of attribute names in the <what> selector:

```
    attrs=<attribute list>
```

A specific value of an attribute is selected by using a single attribute name and also using a value selector:

```
    attrs=<attribute> val[.<style>]=<regex>
```

There are two special *pseudo* attributes `entry` and `children`.  To read (and hence return) a target entry, the subject must have `read` access to the target's *entry* attribute.  To perform a search, the subject must have `search` access to the search base's *entry* attribute. To add or delete an entry, the subject must have `write` access to the entry's `entry` attribute AND must have `write` access to the entry's parent's `children` attribute.  To rename an entry, the subject must have `write` access to entry's `entry` attribute AND have `write` access to both the old parent's and new parent's `children` attributes.  The complete examples at the end of this section should help clear things up.

Lastly, there is a special entry selector `"*"` that is used to select any entry.  It is used when no other `<what>` selector has been provided.  It's equivalent to "`dn=.*`"

### 8.3.2. Who to grant access to

The <who> part identifies the entity or entities being granted  access. Note that access is granted to "entities" not "entries." The  following table summarizes entity specifiers:

| **Specifier**                | **Entities**                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`                          | All, including anonymous and authenticated users |
| `anonymous`                  | Anonymous (non-authenticated) users              |
| `users`                      | Authenticated users                              |
| `self`                       | User associated with target entry                |
| `dn[.<basic-style>]=<regex>` | Users matching a regular expression              |
| `dn.<scope-style>=<DN>`      | Users within scope of a DN                       |

The DN specifier behaves much like <what> clause DN specifiers.

Other control factors are also supported.  For example, a `<who>` can be restricted by an entry listed in a DN-valued attribute in the entry to which the access applies:

```
    dnattr=<dn-valued attribute name>
```

The dnattr specification is used to give access to an entry whose DN  is listed in an attribute of the entry (e.g., give access to a group  entry to whoever is listed as the owner of the group entry).

Some factors may not be appropriate in all environments (or any). For example, the domain factor relies on IP to domain name lookups. As  these can easily be spoofed, the domain factor should be avoided.

### 8.3.3. The access to grant

The kind of <access> granted can be one of the following:

| **Level**  | **Privileges** | **Description**                            |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `none`     | `=0`           | no access                                  |
| `disclose` | `=d`           | needed for information disclosure on error |
| `auth`     | `=dx`          | needed to authenticate (bind)              |
| `compare`  | `=cdx`         | needed to compare                          |
| `search`   | `=scdx`        | needed to apply search filters             |
| `read`     | `=rscdx`       | needed to read search results              |
| `write`    | `=wrscdx`      | needed to modify/rename                    |
| `manage`   | `=mwrscdx`     | needed to manage                           |

Each level implies all lower levels of access. So, for example, granting someone `write` access to an entry also grants them `read`, `search`, `compare`, `auth` and `disclose` access.  However, one may use the privileges specifier to grant specific permissions.

### 8.3.4. Access Control Evaluation

When evaluating whether some requester should be given access to an  entry and/or attribute, slapd compares the entry and/or attribute to the `<what>` selectors given in the configuration.  For each  entry, access controls provided in the database which holds the entry  (or the global access directives if not held in any database) apply  first, followed by the global access directives (which are held in the `frontend` database definition). However, when dealing with an access list,  because the global access list is effectively appended to each  per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access  list will end with an implicit `access to * by * none` directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

Within this priority, access directives are examined in the order in  which they appear in the configuration attribute.  Slapd stops with the  first `<what>` selector that matches the entry and/or  attribute. The corresponding access directive is the one slapd will use  to evaluate access.

Next, slapd compares the entity requesting access to the `<who>` selectors within the access directive selected above in the order in which they appear. It stops with the first `<who>` selector that matches the requester. This determines the access the entity requesting access has to the entry and/or attribute.

Finally, slapd compares the access granted in the selected `<access>` clause to the access requested by the client. If it allows greater or  equal access, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.

The order of evaluation of access directives makes their placement in the configuration file important. If one access directive is more  specific than another in terms of the entries it selects, it should  appear first in the configuration. Similarly, if one `<who>` selector is more specific than another it should come first in the  access directive. The access control examples given below should help  make this clear.

### 8.3.5. Access Control Examples

The access control facility described above is quite powerful.  This  section shows some examples of its use for descriptive purposes.

A simple example:

```
    olcAccess: to * by * read
```

This access directive grants read access to everyone.

```
    olcAccess: to *
        by self write
        by anonymous auth
        by * read
```

This directive allows the user to modify their entry, allows  anonymous to authenticate against these entries, and allows all others  to read these entries.  Note that only the first `by <who>` clause which matches applies.  Hence, the anonymous users are granted `auth`, not `read`.  The last clause could just as well have been "`by users read`".

It is often desirable to restrict operations based upon the level of  protection in place.  The following shows how security strength factors  (SSF) can be used.

```
    olcAccess: to *
        by ssf=128 self write
        by ssf=64 anonymous auth
        by ssf=64 users read
```

This directive allows users to modify their own entries if security  protections of strength 128 or better have been established, allows  authentication access to anonymous users, and read access when strength  64 or better security protections have been established.  If the client  has not establish sufficient security protections, the implicit `by * none` clause would be applied.

The following example shows the use of style specifiers to select the entries by DN in two access directives where ordering is significant.

```
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read
```

Read access is granted to entries under the `dc=com` subtree, except for those entries under the `dc=example,dc=com` subtree, to which search access is granted.  No access is granted to `dc=com` as neither access directive matches this DN.  If the order of these  access directives was reversed, the trailing directive would never be  reached, since all entries under `dc=example,dc=com` are also under `dc=com` entries.

Also note that if no `olcAccess: to` directive matches or no `by <who>` clause, **access is denied**.  When dealing with an access list, because the global access list is  effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit `access to * by * none` directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a backend, then a default read is used.

The next example again shows the importance of ordering, both of the access directives and the `by <who>` clauses.  It also shows the use of an attribute selector to grant access to a specific attribute and various `<who>` selectors.

```
    olcAccess: to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com" attrs=homePhone
        by self write
        by dn.children=dc=example,dc=com" search
        by peername.regex=IP=10\..+ read
    olcAccess: to dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
        by self write
        by dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" search
        by anonymous auth
```

This example applies to entries in the "`dc=example,dc=com`" subtree. To all attributes except `homePhone`, an entry can write to itself, entries under `example.com` entries can search by them, anybody else has no access (implicit `by * none`) excepting for authentication/authorization (which is always done anonymously).  The `homePhone` attribute is writable by the entry, searchable by entries under `example.com`, readable by clients connecting from network 10, and otherwise not readable (implicit `by * none`).  All other access is denied by the implicit `access to * by * none`.

Sometimes it is useful to permit a particular DN to add or remove  itself from an attribute. For example, if you would like to create a  group and allow people to add and remove only their own DN from the  member attribute, you could accomplish it with an access directive like  this:

```
    olcAccess: to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
```

The dnattr `<who>` selector says that the access applies to entries listed in the `member` attribute. The `selfwrite` access selector says that such members can only add or delete their own DN from the attribute, not other values. The addition of the entry  attribute is required because access to the entry is required to access  any of the entry's attributes.

### 8.3.6. Access Control Ordering

Since the ordering of `olcAccess` directives is essential to  their proper evaluation, but LDAP attributes normally do not preserve  the ordering of their values, OpenLDAP uses a custom schema extension to maintain a fixed ordering of these values. This ordering is maintained  by prepending a `"{X}"` numeric index to each value, similarly to the approach used for ordering the configuration entries. These index  tags are maintained automatically by slapd and do not need to be  specified when originally defining the values. For example, when you  create the settings

```
    olcAccess: to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read
```

when you read them back using slapcat or ldapsearch they will contain

```
    olcAccess: {0}to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
    olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * search
    olcAccess: {2}to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read
```

The numeric index may be used to specify a particular value to change when using ldapmodify to edit the access rules. This index can be used  instead of (or in addition to) the actual access value. Using this  numeric index is very helpful when multiple access rules are being  managed.

For example, if we needed to change the second rule above to grant write access instead of search, we could try this LDIF:

```
    changetype: modify
    delete: olcAccess
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * search
    -
    add: olcAccess
    olcAccess: to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * write
    -
```

But this example **will not** guarantee that the existing values  remain in their original order, so it will most likely yield a broken  security configuration. Instead, the numeric index should be used:

```
    changetype: modify
    delete: olcAccess
    olcAccess: {1}
    -
    add: olcAccess
    olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com" by * write
    -
```

This example deletes whatever rule is in value #1 of the `olcAccess` attribute (regardless of its value) and adds a new value that is explicitly inserted as value #1. The result will be

```
    olcAccess: {0}to attrs=member,entry
         by dnattr=member selfwrite
    olcAccess: {1}to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
         by * write
    olcAccess: {2}to dn.children="dc=com"
         by * read
```

which is exactly what was intended.

------

## 8.4. Access Control Common Examples

### 8.4.1. Basic ACLs

Generally one should start with some basic ACLs such as:

```
    access to attrs=userPassword
        by self =xw
        by anonymous auth
        by * none


      access to *
        by self write
        by users read
        by * none
```

The first ACL allows users to update (but not read) their passwords,  anonymous users to authenticate against this attribute, and (implicitly) denying all access to others.

The second ACL allows users full access to their entry, authenticated users read access to anything, and (implicitly) denying all access to  others (in this case, anonymous users).

### 8.4.2. Matching Anonymous and Authenticated users

An anonymous user has a empty DN. While the *dn.exact=""* or *dn.regex="^$"* could be used, *slapd*(8)) offers an anonymous shorthand which should be used instead.

```
    access to *
      by anonymous none
      by * read
```

denies all access to anonymous users while granting others read.

Authenticated users have a subject DN. While *dn.regex=".+"* will match any authenticated user, OpenLDAP provides the users short hand which should be used instead.

```
    access to *
      by users read
      by * none
```

This ACL grants read permissions to authenticated users while denying others (i.e.: anonymous users).

### 8.4.3. Controlling rootdn access

You could specify the *rootdn* in *slapd.conf*(5) or *slapd.d* without specifying a *rootpw*. Then you have to add an actual directory entry with the same dn, e.g.:

```
    dn: cn=Manager,o=MyOrganization
    cn: Manager
    sn: Manager
    objectClass: person
    objectClass: top
    userPassword: {SSHA}someSSHAdata
```

Then binding as the *rootdn* will require a regular bind to that DN, which in turn requires auth access to that entry's DN and *userPassword*, and this can be restricted via ACLs. E.g.:

```
    access to dn.base="cn=Manager,o=MyOrganization"
      by peername.regex=127\.0\.0\.1 auth
      by peername.regex=192\.168\.0\..* auth
      by users none
      by * none
```

The ACLs above will only allow binding using rootdn from localhost and 192.168.0.0/24.

### 8.4.4. Controlling the LDAP Proxied Authorization Control

The Proxied Authorization Control allows a client to request that an  operation be processed under a provided authorization identity instead  of under the current authentication identity associated with the  connection.

This facility is controlled by the `authz-policy` configuration option and by the `authzTo` and `authzFrom` attributes. It can be further controlled by applying access control to those attributes.

A client application might bind as cn=Client,o=MyOrganization whose entry looks like this:

```
    dn: cn=Client,o=MyOrganization
    cn: Client
    objectClass: organizationalRole
    objectClass: simpleSecurityObject
    objectClass: top
    userPassword: {SSHA}someSSHAdata
    authzTo: dn.regex:^cn=[^,]+,ou=People,o=MyOrganization$
```

To make use of the proxy facility, the client needs at least `auth` privilege on the `authzTo` attribute:

```
    access to dn.exact=cn=Client,o=MyOrganization attr=authzTo
      by self auth
      by * break
```

This access would be automatically granted if cn=Client,o=MyOrganization has `read` privilege on its own entry.

Now if you want to lock down the use of this powerful account, you might write an ACL like this:

```
    access to dn.exact=cn=Client,o=MyOrganization attr=authzTo
      by self peername.regex=192\.168\.0\..*  ssf=256 auth
      by * none
```

Now, cn=Client,o=MyOrganization can only make use of the proxy  authorization control if it has connected from an appropriate IP address using a sufficient level of cryptographic protection. No other IDs can  even see the authzTo attribute.

### 8.4.5. Managing access with Groups

There are a few ways to do this. One approach is illustrated here. Consider the following DIT layout:

```
    +-dc=example,dc=com
    +---cn=administrators,dc=example,dc=com
    +---cn=fred blogs,dc=example,dc=com
```

and the following group object (in LDIF format):

```
    dn: cn=administrators,dc=example,dc=com
    cn: administrators of this region
    objectclass: groupOfNames  (important for the group acl feature)
    member: cn=fred blogs,dc=example,dc=com
    member: cn=somebody else,dc=example,dc=com
```

One can then grant access to the members of this this group by adding appropriate *by group* clause to an access directive in *slapd.conf*(5). For instance,

```
    access to dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
        by self write
        by group.exact="cn=Administrators,dc=example,dc=com" write
        by * auth
```

Like by *dn* clauses, one can also use *expand* to expand the group name based upon the regular expression matching of the target, that is, the to *dn.regex*). For instance,

```
    access to dn.regex="(.+,)?ou=People,(dc=[^,]+,dc=[^,]+)$"
             attrs=children,entry,uid
        by group.expand="cn=Managers,$2" write
        by users read
        by * auth
```

The above illustration assumed that the group members are to be found in the *member* attribute type of the *groupOfNames* object class. If you need to use a different group object and/or a different attribute type then use the following *slapd.conf*(5) (abbreviated) syntax:

```
    access to <what>
            by group/<objectclass>/<attributename>=<DN> <access>
```

For example:

```
    access to *
      by group/organizationalRole/roleOccupant="cn=Administrator,dc=example,dc=com" write
```

In this case, we have an ObjectClass *organizationalRole* which contains the administrator DN's in the *roleOccupant* attribute. For instance:

```
    dn: cn=Administrator,dc=example,dc=com
    cn: Administrator
    objectclass: organizationalRole
    roleOccupant: cn=Jane Doe,dc=example,dc=com
```



------

**Note:** the specified member attribute type MUST be of DN or *NameAndOptionalUID* syntax, and the specified object class SHOULD allow the attribute type.

------



Dynamic Groups are also supported in Access Control. Please see *slapo-dynlist*(5) and the [Dynamic Lists](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/overlays.html#Dynamic Lists) overlay section.

### 8.4.6. Granting access to a subset of attributes

You can grant access to a set of attributes by specifying a list of attribute names in the ACL *to* clause. To be useful, you also need to grant access to the *entry* itself. Also note how *children* controls the ability to add, delete, and rename entries.

```
    # mail: self may write, authenticated users may read
    access to attrs=mail
      by self write
      by users read
      by * none

    # cn, sn: self my write, all may read
    access to attrs=cn,sn
      by self write
      by * read

    # immediate children: only self can add/delete entries under this entry
    access to attrs=children
      by self write

    # entry itself: self may write, all may read
    access to attrs=entry
      by self write
      by * read

    # other attributes: self may write, others have no access
    access to *
      by self write
      by * none
```

ObjectClass names may also be specified in this list, which will  affect all the attributes that are required and/or allowed by that *objectClass*. Actually, names in *attrlist* that are prefixed by *@* are directly treated as objectClass names. A name prefixed by *!* is also treated as an objectClass, but in this case the access rule  affects the attributes that are not required nor allowed by that *objectClass*.

### 8.4.7. Allowing a user write to all entries below theirs

For a setup where a user can write to its own record and to all of its children:

```
    access to dn.regex="(.+,)?(uid=[^,]+,o=Company)$"
       by dn.exact,expand="$2" write
       by anonymous auth
```

(Add more examples for above)

### 8.4.8. Allowing entry creation

Let's say, you have it like this:

```
        o=<basedn>
            ou=domains
                associatedDomain=<somedomain>
                    ou=users
                        uid=<someuserid>
                        uid=<someotheruserid>
                    ou=addressbooks
                        uid=<someuserid>
                            cn=<someone>
                            cn=<someoneelse>
```

and, for another domain <someotherdomain>:

```
        o=<basedn>
            ou=domains
                associatedDomain=<someotherdomain>
                    ou=users
                        uid=<someuserid>
                        uid=<someotheruserid>
                    ou=addressbooks
                        uid=<someotheruserid>
                            cn=<someone>
                            cn=<someoneelse>
```

then, if you wanted user *uid=<someuserid>* to **ONLY** create an entry for its own thing, you could write an ACL like this:

```
    # this rule lets users of "associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>"
    # write under "ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>,ou=domains,o=<basedn>",
    # i.e. a user can write ANY entry below its domain's address book;
    # this permission is necessary, but not sufficient, the next
    # will restrict this permission further


    access to dn.regex="^ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=([^,]+),ou=domains,o=<basedn>$" attrs=children
            by dn.regex="^uid=([^,]+),ou=users,associatedDomain=$1,ou=domains,o=<basedn>$$" write
            by * none


    # Note that above the "by" clause needs a "regex" style to make sure
    # it expands to a DN that starts with a "uid=<someuserid>" pattern
    # while substituting the associatedDomain submatch from the "what" clause.


    # This rule lets a user with "uid=<matcheduid>" of "<associatedDomain=matcheddomain>"
    # write (i.e. add, modify, delete) the entry whose DN is exactly
    # "uid=<matcheduid>,ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=<matcheddomain>,ou=domains,o=<basedn>"
    # and ANY entry as subtree of it


    access to dn.regex="^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),ou=addressbook,associatedDomain=([^,]+),ou=domains,o=<basedn>$"
            by dn.exact,expand="uid=$2,ou=users,associatedDomain=$3,ou=domains,o=<basedn>" write
            by * none


    # Note that above the "by" clause uses the "exact" style with the "expand"
    # modifier because now the whole pattern can be rebuilt by means of the
    # submatches from the "what" clause, so a "regex" compilation and evaluation
    # is no longer required.
```

### 8.4.9. Tips for using regular expressions in Access Control

Always use *dn.regex=<pattern>* when you intend to use regular expression matching. *dn=<pattern>* alone defaults to *dn.exact<pattern>*.

Use *(.+)* instead of *(.\*)* when you want at least one char to be matched. *(.\*)* matches the empty string as well.

Don't use regular expressions for matches that can be done otherwise in a safer and cheaper manner. Examples:

```
    dn.regex=".*dc=example,dc=com"
```

is unsafe and expensive:

- unsafe because any string containing *dc=example,dc=com* will match, not only those that end with the desired pattern; use *.\*dc=example,dc=com$* instead.
- unsafe also because it would allow any *attributeType* ending with *dc* as naming attribute for the first RDN in the string, e.g. a custom attributeType *mydc* would match as well. If you really need a regular expression that allows just *dc=example,dc=com* or any of its subtrees, use *^(.+,)?dc=example,dc=com$*, which means: anything to the left of dc=..., if any (the question mark  after the pattern within brackets), must end with a comma;
- expensive because if you don't need submatches, you could use scoping styles, e.g.

```
    dn.subtree="dc=example,dc=com"
```

to include *dc=example,dc=com* in the matching patterns,

```
    dn.children="dc=example,dc=com"
```

to exclude *dc=example,dc=com* from the matching patterns, or

```
    dn.onelevel="dc=example,dc=com"
```

to allow exactly one sublevel matches only.

Always use *^* and *$* in regexes, whenever appropriate, because *ou=(.+),ou=(.+),ou=addressbooks,o=basedn* will match *something=bla,ou=xxx,ou=yyy,ou=addressbooks,o=basedn,ou=addressbooks,o=basedn,dc=some,dc=org*

Always use *([^,]+)* to indicate exactly one RDN, because *(.+)* can include any number of RDNs; e.g. *ou=(.+),dc=example,dc=com* will match *ou=My,o=Org,dc=example,dc=com*, which might not be what you want.

Never add the rootdn to the by clauses. ACLs are not even processed  for operations performed with rootdn identity (otherwise there would be  no reason to define a rootdn at all).

Use shorthands. The user directive matches authenticated users and the anonymous directive matches anonymous users.

Don't use the *dn.regex* form for <by> clauses if all you need is scoping and/or substring replacement; use scoping styles (e.g. *exact*, *onelevel*, *children* or *subtree*) and the style modifier expand to cause substring expansion.

For instance,

```
    access to dn.regex=".+,dc=([^,]+),dc=([^,]+)$"
      by dn.regex="^[^,],ou=Admin,dc=$1,dc=$2$$" write
```

although correct, can be safely and efficiently replaced by

```
    access to dn.regex=".+,(dc=[^,]+,dc=[^,]+)$"
      by dn.onelevel,expand="ou=Admin,$1" write
```

where the regex in the *<what>* clause is more compact, and the one in the *<by>* clause is replaced by a much more efficient scoping style of onelevel with substring expansion.

### 8.4.10. Granting and Denying access based on security strength factors (ssf)

You can restrict access based on the security strength factor (SSF)

```
    access to dn="cn=example,cn=edu"
          by * ssf=256 read
```

0 (zero) implies no protection, 1 implies integrity protection only,  56 DES or other weak ciphers, 112 triple DES and similar ciphers, 128  RC4, Blowfish and other similar ciphers, 256 modern ciphers.

Other possibilities:

```
    transport_ssf=<n>
    tls_ssf=<n>
    sasl_ssf=<n>
```

256 is recommended.

See *slapd.conf*(5) for information on *ssf*.

### 8.4.11. When things aren't working as expected

Consider this example:

```
    access to *
      by anonymous auth

    access to *
      by self write

    access to *
      by users read
```

You may think this will allow any user to login, to read everything  and change his own data if he is logged in. But in this example only the login works and an ldapsearch returns no data. The Problem is that  SLAPD goes through its access config line by line and stops as soon as  it finds a match in the part of the access rule.(here: *to **)

To get what we wanted the file has to read:

```
    access to *
      by anonymous auth
      by self write
      by users read
```

The general rule is: "special access rules first, generic access rules last"

See also *slapd.access*(5), loglevel 128 and *slapacl*(8) for debugging information.

## 8.5. Sets - Granting rights based on relationships

Sets are best illustrated via examples. The following sections will  present a few set ACL examples in order to facilitate their  understanding.

(Sets in Access Controls FAQ Entry: http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1133.html)



------

**Note:** Sets are considered experimental.

------



### 8.5.1. Groups of Groups

The OpenLDAP ACL for groups doesn't expand groups within groups,  which are groups that have another group as a member. For example:

```
 dn: cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: sudoadm
 objectClass: groupOfNames
 member: uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
 member: cn=accountadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com

 dn: cn=accountadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: accountadm
 objectClass: groupOfNames
 member: uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
```

If we use standard group ACLs with the above entries and allow members of the `sudoadm` group to write somewhere, `mary` won't be included:

```
 access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
         by group.exact="cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com" write
         by * read
```

With sets we can make the ACL be recursive and consider group within  groups. So for each member that is a group, it is further expanded:

```
 access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
       by set="[cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/member* & user" write
       by * read
```

This set ACL means: take the `cn=sudoadm` DN, check its `member` attribute(s) (where the "`*`" means recursively) and intersect the result with the authenticated  user's DN. If the result is non-empty, the ACL is considered a match and write access is granted.

The following drawing explains how this set is built:



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/set-recursivegroup.png)



Figure X.Y: Populating a recursive group set

First we get the `uid=john` DN. This entry doesn't have a `member` attribute, so the expansion stops here.  Now we get to `cn=accountadm`. This one does have a `member` attribute, which is `uid=mary`. The `uid=mary` entry, however, doesn't have member, so we stop here again. The end comparison is:

```
 {"uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com","uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"} & user
```

If the authenticated user's DN is any one of those two, write access is granted. So this set will include `mary` in the `sudoadm` group and she will be allowed the write access.

### 8.5.2. Group ACLs without DN syntax

The traditional group ACLs, and even the previous example about  recursive groups, require that the members are specified as DNs instead  of just usernames.

With sets, however, it's also possible to use simple names in group ACLs, as this example will show.

Let's say we want to allow members of the `sudoadm` group to write to the `ou=sudoers` branch of our tree. But our group definition now is using `memberUid` for the group members:

```
 dn: cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
 cn: sudoadm
 objectClass: posixGroup
 gidNumber: 1000
 memberUid: john
```

With this type of group, we can't use group ACLs. But with a set ACL we can grant the desired access:

```
 access to dn.subtree="ou=sudoers,dc=example,dc=com"
       by set="[cn=sudoadm,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/memberUid & user/uid" write
       by * read
```

We use a simple intersection where we compare the `uid` attribute of the connecting (and authenticated) user with the `memberUid` attributes of the group. If they match, the intersection is non-empty and the ACL will grant write access.

This drawing illustrates this set when the connecting user is authenticated as `uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com`:



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/set-memberUid.png)



Figure X.Y: Sets with `memberUid`

In this case, it's a match. If it were `mary` authenticating, however, she would be denied write access to `ou=sudoers` because her `uid` attribute is not listed in the group's `memberUid`.

### 8.5.3. Following references

We will now show a quite powerful example of what can be done with  sets. This example tends to make OpenLDAP administrators smile after  they have understood it and its implications.

Let's start with an user entry:

```
 dn: uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
 uid: john
 objectClass: inetOrgPerson
 givenName: John
 sn: Smith
 cn: john
 manager: uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
```

Writing an ACL to allow the manager to update some attributes is quite simple using sets:

```
 access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
    by self write
    by set="this/manager & user" write
    by * read
```

In that set, `this` expands to the entry being accessed, so that `this/manager` expands to `uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com` when john's entry is accessed.  If the manager herself is accessing  John's entry, the ACL will match and write access to those attributes  will be granted.

So far, this same behavior can be obtained with the `dnattr`  keyword. With sets, however, we can further enhance this ACL. Let's say  we want to allow the secretary of the manager to also update these  attributes. This is how we do it:

```
 access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
    by self write
    by set="this/manager & user" write
    by set="this/manager/secretary & user" write
    by * read
```

Now we need a picture to help explain what is happening here (entries shortened for clarity):



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/set-following-references.png)



Figure X.Y: Sets jumping through entries

In this example, Jane is the secretary of Mary, which is the manager of John. This whole relationship is defined with the `manager` and `secretary` attributes, which are both of the distinguishedName syntax (i.e., full DNs). So, when the `uid=john` entry is being accessed, the `this/manager/secretary` set becomes `{"uid=jane,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"`} (follow the references in the picture):

```
 this = [uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]
 this/manager = \
   [uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]/manager = uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
 this/manager/secretary = \
   [uid=mary,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]/secretary = uid=jane,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
```

The end result is that when Jane accesses John's entry, she will be  granted write access to the specified attributes. Better yet, this will  happen to any entry she accesses which has Mary as the manager.

This is all cool and nice, but perhaps gives too much power to  secretaries. Maybe we need to further restrict it. For example, let's  only allow executive secretaries to have this power:

```
 access to dn.exact="uid=john,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
   attrs=carLicense,homePhone,mobile,pager,telephoneNumber
   by self write
   by set="this/manager & user" write
   by set="this/manager/secretary &
           [cn=executive,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com]/member* &
           user" write
   by * read
```

It's almost the same ACL as before, but we now also require that the connecting user be a member of the (possibly nested) `cn=executive` group.

# 9. Limits

------

## 9.1. Introduction

It is usually desirable to limit the server resources that can be  consumed by each LDAP client. OpenLDAP provides two sets of limits: a  size limit, which can restrict the *number* of entries that a  client can retrieve in a single operation, and a time limit which  restricts the length of time that an operation may continue. Both types  of limit can be given different values depending on who initiated the  operation.

------

## 9.2. Soft and Hard limits

The server administrator can specify both *soft limits* and *hard limits*. Soft limits can be thought of as being the default limit value. Hard limits cannot be exceeded by ordinary LDAP users.

LDAP clients can specify their own size and time limits when issuing  search operations. This feature has been present since the earliest  version of X.500.

If the client specifies a limit then the lower of the requested value and the *hard limit* will become the limit for the operation.

If the client does not specify a limit then the server applies the *soft limit*.

Soft and Hard limits are often referred to together as *administrative limits*. Thus, if an LDAP client requests a search that would return more results than the limits allow it will get an *adminLimitExceeded* error. Note that the server will usually return some results even if  the limit has been exceeded: this feature is useful to clients that just want to check for the existence of some entries without needing to see  them all.

The *rootdn* is not subject to any limits.

------

## 9.3. Global Limits

Limits specified in the global part of the server configuration act  as defaults which are used if no database has more specific limits set.

In a *slapd.conf*(5) configuration the keywords are `sizelimit` and `timelimit`. When using the *slapd config* backend, the corresponding attributes are `olcSizeLimit` and `olcTimeLimit`. The syntax of these values are the same in both cases.

The simple form sets both soft and hard limits to the same value:

```
   sizelimit {<integer>|unlimited}
   timelimit {<integer>|unlimited}
```

The default sizelimit is 500 entries and the default timelimit is 3600 seconds.

An extended form allows soft and hard limits to be set separately:

```
   sizelimit size[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]
   timelimit time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]
```

Thus, to set a soft sizelimit of 10 entries and a hard limit of 75 entries:

```
  sizelimit size.soft=10 size.hard=75
```

### 9.3.1. Special Size Limits

There are other forms of size limits in addition to the soft and hard limits. Note that when using the simple *sizelimit* form, none of these special limits are changed.

#### 9.3.1.1. Unchecked Limits

The *unchecked* keyword sets a limit on how many entries the  server will examine after doing index lookups but before evaluating  filter matches. If the set of candidates exceeds this limit, the search  is aborted. The purpose is to avoid causing excessive workload on *slapd* if a filter uses attributes that are not properly indexed, and can be critical for very large directories.

```
   sizelimit size.unchecked={<integer>|unlimited|disabled}
```

The default is unlimited. The *disabled* setting prevents a  search from being performed at all. This may be useful in the  per-database limits described below, to disallow searches for a specific set of users.

#### 9.3.1.2. Paged Results Limits

If the LDAP client adds the *pagedResultsControl* to the  search operation, the hard size limit is used by default, because the  request for a specific page size is considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number of entries to be returned. However, the size  limit applies to the total count of entries returned within the search,  and not to a single page.

Additional size limits may be enforced for paged searches.

The `size.pr` limit controls the maximum page size:

```
   sizelimit size.pr={<integer>|noEstimate|unlimited}
```

`<integer>` is the maximum page size if no explicit size is set. `noEstimate` has no effect in the current implementation as the server does not return an estimate of the result size anyway. `unlimited` indicates that no limit is applied to the maximum page size.

The `size.prtotal` limit controls the total number of entries  that can be returned by a paged search. By default the limit is the same as the normal `size.hard` limit.

```
   size.prtotal={<integer>|unlimited|disabled}
```

`unlimited` removes the limit on the number of entries that can be returned by a paged search. `disabled` can be used to selectively disable paged result searches.

------

## 9.4. Per-Database Limits

Each database can have its own set of limits that override the global ones. The syntax is more flexible, and it allows different limits to be applied to different entities. Note that an *entity* is different from an *entry*: the term *entity* is used here to indicate the ID of the person or process that has initiated the LDAP operation.

In a *slapd.conf*(5) configuration the keyword is `limits`. When using the *slapd config* backend, the corresponding attribute is `olcLimits`. The syntax of the values is the same in both cases.

```
   limits <selector> <limit> [<limit> [...]]
```

The *limits* clause can be specified multiple times to apply  different limits to different initiators. The server examines each  clause in turn until it finds one that matches the operation's initiator or base DN. If no match is found, the global limits will be used.

### 9.4.1. Specify who the limits apply to

The `<selector>` part of the *limits* clause can take any of these values:

| **Specifier**                      | **Entities**                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`                                | All, including anonymous and authenticated users     |
| `anonymous`                        | Anonymous (non-authenticated) users                  |
| `users`                            | Authenticated users                                  |
| `dn[.<type>][.<style>]=<pattern>]` | Entry or entries within a scope that match <pattern> |
| `group[/oc[/at]]=<pattern>`        | Members of a group                                   |

Where

*type* can be one of self or this and

*style* can be one of exact, base, onelevel, subtree, children, regex, or anonymous

More information can be found in the *slapd.conf*(5) or *slapd-config*(5) manual pages.

### 9.4.2. Specify time limits

The syntax for time limits is

```
   time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer>
```

where integer is the number of seconds slapd will spend answering a search request.

If neither *soft* nor *hard* is specified, the value is used for both, e.g.:

```
   limits anonymous time=27
```

The value *unlimited* may be used to remove the hard time limit entirely, e.g.:

```
   limits dn.exact="cn=anyuser,dc=example,dc=org" time.hard=unlimited
```

### 9.4.3. Specifying size limits

The syntax for size limit is

```
   size[.{soft|hard}]=<integer>
```

where `<integer>` is the maximum number of entries slapd will return when answering a search request.

In addition to soft and hard limits, other limits are also available, with the same meanings described for the global limits configuration  above.

------

## 9.5. Example Limit Configurations

### 9.5.1. Simple Global Limits

This simple global configuration fragment applies size and time limits to all searches by all users except *rootdn*. It limits searches to 50 results and sets an overall time limit of 10 seconds.

```
   sizelimit 50
   timelimit 10
```

### 9.5.2. Global Hard and Soft Limits

It is sometimes useful to limit the size of result sets but to allow  clients to request a higher limit where needed. This can be achieved by  setting separate hard and soft limits.

```
   sizelimit size.soft=5 size.hard=100
```

To prevent clients from doing very inefficient non-indexed searches, add the *unchecked* limit:

```
   sizelimit size.soft=5 size.hard=100 size.unchecked=100
```

### 9.5.3. Giving specific users larger limits

Having set appropriate default limits in the global configuration,  you may want to give certain users the ability to retrieve larger result sets. Here is a way to do that in the per-database configuration:

```
   limits dn.exact="cn=anyuser,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
   limits dn.exact="cn=personnel,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
   limits dn.exact="cn=dirsync,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
```

It is generally best to avoid mentioning specific users in the server configuration. A better way is to give the higher limits to a group:

```
   limits group/groupOfNames/member="cn=bigwigs,dc=example,dc=org" size=100000
```

### 9.5.4. Limiting who can do paged searches

It may be required that certain applications need very large result  sets that they retrieve using paged searches, but that you do not want  ordinary LDAP users to use the pagedResults control. The *pr* and *prtotal* limits can help:

```
   limits group/groupOfNames/member="cn=dirsync,dc=example,dc=org" size.prtotal=unlimited
   limits users size.soft=5 size.hard=100 size.prtotal=disabled
   limits anonymous size.soft=2 size.hard=5 size.prtotal=disabled
```

------

## 9.6. Glued/Subordinate database configurations

When using subordinate databases, it is necessary for any limits that are to be applied across the parent and its subordinates to be defined  in both the parent and its subordinates. Otherwise the settings on the  subordinate databases are not honored.

------

## 9.7. Further Information

For further information please see *slapd.conf*(5), *ldapsearch*(1) and *slapd.access*(5)



------

# 10. Database Creation and Maintenance Tools

This section tells you how to create a slapd database from scratch,  and how to do trouble shooting if you run into problems. There are two  ways to create a database. First, you can create the database on-line  using LDAP. With this method, you simply start up slapd and add entries using the LDAP client of your choice. This method is fine  for relatively small databases (a few hundred or thousand entries,  depending on your requirements). This method works for database types  which support updates.

The second method of database creation is to do it off-line using special utilities provided with *slapd*(8). This method is best if you have many thousands of entries to create,  which would take an unacceptably long time using the LDAP method, or if  you want to ensure the database is not accessed while it is being  created. Note that not all database types support these utilities.

------

## 10.1. Creating a database over LDAP

With this method, you use the LDAP client of your choice (e.g., the *ldapadd*(1)) to add entries, just like you would once the database is created.  You  should be sure to set the following options in the configuration file  before starting *slapd*(8).

```
        suffix <dn>
```

As described in the [General Database Directives](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html#General Database Directives) section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this  database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you  are trying to create.  For example:

```
        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
```

You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:

```
        directory <directory>
```

For example:

```
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
```

You need to create this directory with appropriate permissions such that slapd can write to it.

You need to configure slapd so that you can connect to it as a  directory user with permission to add entries. You can configure the  directory to support a special *super-user* or *root* user just for this purpose. This is done through the following two options in the database definition:

```
        rootdn <dn>
        rootpw <passwd>
```

For example:

```
        rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
        rootpw secret
```

These options specify a DN and password that can be used to authenticate as the *super-user* entry of the database (i.e., the entry allowed to do anything). The DN  and password specified here will always work, regardless of whether the  entry named actually exists or has the password given. This solves the  chicken-and-egg problem of how to authenticate and add entries before  any entries yet exist.

Finally, you should make sure that the database definition contains the index definitions you want:

```
        index {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]
```

For example, to index the `cn`, `sn`, `uid` and `objectclass` attributes, the following `index` directives could be used:

```
        index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
        index objectClass eq
```

This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the `cn`, `sn`, and `uid` attributes and an equality index for the `objectClass` attribute.  Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types.  See [The slapd Configuration File](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html) section for more information on this option.

Once you have configured things to your liking, start up slapd,  connect with your LDAP client, and start adding entries.  For example,  to add an organization entry and an organizational role entry using the *ldapadd* tool, you could create an LDIF file called `entries.ldif` with the contents:

```
        # Organization for Example Corporation
        dn: dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: dcObject
        objectClass: organization
        dc: example
        o: Example Corporation
        description: The Example Corporation

        # Organizational Role for Directory Manager
        dn: cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
        objectClass: organizationalRole
        cn: Manager
        description: Directory Manager
```

and then use a command like this to actually create the entry:

```
        ldapadd -f entries.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -w secret
```

The above command assumes settings provided in the above examples.

------

## 10.2. Creating a database off-line

The second method of database creation is to do it off-line, using  the slapd database tools described below. This method is best if you  have many thousands of entries to create, which would take an  unacceptably long time to add using the LDAP method described above.  These tools read the slapd configuration file and an input file  containing a text representation of the entries to add. For database  types which support the tools, they produce the database files directly  (otherwise you must use the on-line method above). Also, the input file  must be completely valid, as these tools do fewer consistency checks  than the on-line method.



------

**Note:** this Guide is not meant to provide exhaustive  documentation on the software. The tool descriptions here only list a  few of the available options for each command. Read the associated  manpages for complete documentation on all of the available options.

------



There are several important configuration options you will want to be sure and set in the config file database definition first:

```
        suffix <dn>
```

As described in the [General Database Directives](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html#General Database Directives) section, this option defines which entries are to be held by this  database. You should set this to the DN of the root of the subtree you  are trying to create.  For example:

```
        suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
```

You should be sure to specify a directory where the index files should be created:

```
        directory <directory>
```

For example:

```
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-data
```

Finally, you need to specify which indices you want to build.  This is done by one or more index options.

```
        index {<attrlist> | default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,none]
```

For example:

```
        index cn,sn,uid pres,eq,approx,sub
        index objectClass eq
```

This would create presence, equality, approximate, and substring indices for the `cn`, `sn`, and `uid` attributes and an equality index for the `objectClass` attribute.  Note that not all index types are available with all attribute types.  See [The slapd Configuration File](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html) section for more information on this option.

### 10.2.1. The `slapadd` program

Once you've configured things to your liking, you create the primary database and associated indices by running the *slapadd*(8) program:

```
        slapadd -l <inputfile> -f <slapdconfigfile>
                [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <integer>|-b <suffix>]
```

The arguments have the following meanings:

```
        -l <inputfile>
```

Specifies the LDIF input file containing the entries to add in text form (described below in the [The LDIF text entry format](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/dbtools.html#The LDIF text entry format) section).

```
        -f <slapdconfigfile>
```

Specifies the slapd configuration file that tells where to create the indices, what indices to create, etc.

```
        -F <slapdconfdirectory>
```

Specifies a config directory.  If both `-f` and `-F`  are specified, the config file will be read and converted to config   directory format and written to the specified directory.  If neither  option is specified, an attempt to read the default config directory  will be made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid  config directory exists then the default config file is ignored. If  dryrun mode is also specified, no conversion will occur.

```
        -d <debuglevel>
```

Turn on debugging, as specified by `<debuglevel>`. The debug levels are the same as for slapd.  See the [Command-Line Options](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/runningslapd.html#Command-Line Options) section in [Running slapd](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/runningslapd.html).

```
        -n <databasenumber>
```

An optional argument that specifies which database to modify.  The first database listed in the configuration file is `1`, the second `2`, etc. By default, the first database in the configuration file is used. Should not be used in conjunction with `-b`.

```
        -b <suffix>
```

An optional argument that specifies which database to modify.  The provided suffix is matched against a database `suffix` directive to determine the database number. Should not be used in conjunction with `-n`.

### 10.2.2. The `slapindex` program

Sometimes it may be necessary to regenerate indices (such as after modifying *slapd.conf*(5)). This is possible using the *slapindex*(8) program.  *slapindex* is invoked like this

```
        slapindex -f <slapdconfigfile>
                [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <databasenumber>|-b <suffix>] [attr...]
```

Where the `-f`, `-d`, `-n` and `-b` options are the same as for the *slapadd*(1) program.  If no specific attributes are listed, *slapindex* rebuilds all indices based upon the current database contents.

### 10.2.3. The `slapcat` program

The `slapcat` program is used to dump the database to an LDIF file.  This can be useful when you want to make a human-readable backup of your database or when you want to edit your database off-line.  The  program is invoked like this:

```
        slapcat -l <filename> -f <slapdconfigfile>
                [-d <debuglevel>] [-n <databasenumber>|-b <suffix>]
```

where `-n` or `-b` is used to select the database in the *slapd.conf*(5) specified using `-f`.  The corresponding LDIF output is written to standard output or to the file specified using the `-l` option.

------

## 10.3. The LDIF text entry format

The LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is used to  represent LDAP entries in a simple text format.  This section provides a brief description of the LDIF entry format which complements *ldif*(5) and the technical specification [RFC2849](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt).

The basic form of an entry is:

```
        # comment
        dn: <distinguished name>
        <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
        <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>

        ...
```

Lines starting with a '`#`' character are comments.  An attribute description may be a simple attribute type like `cn` or `objectClass` or `1.2.3` (an OID associated with an attribute type) or may include options such as `cn;lang_en_US` or `userCertificate;binary`.

A line may be continued by starting the next line with a *single* space or tab character.  For example:

```
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=
         com
        cn: Barbara J
          Jensen
```

is equivalent to:

```
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Barbara J Jensen
```

Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines. e.g.,

```
        cn: Barbara J Jensen
        cn: Babs Jensen
```

If an `<attrvalue>` contains non-printing characters or begins with a space, a colon ('`:`'), or a less than ('`<`'), the `<attrdesc>` is followed by a double colon and the base64 encoding of the value.  For example, the value "` begins with a space`" would be encoded like this:

```
        cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=
```

You can also specify a URL containing the attribute value. For example, the following specifies the `jpegPhoto` value should be obtained from the file `/path/to/file.jpeg`.

```
        jpegPhoto:< file:///path/to/file.jpeg
```

Multiple entries within the same LDIF file are separated by blank  lines. Here's an example of an LDIF file containing three entries.

```
        # Barbara's Entry
        dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Barbara J Jensen
        cn: Babs Jensen
        objectClass: person
        sn: Jensen

        # Bjorn's Entry
        dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Bjorn J Jensen
        cn: Bjorn Jensen
        objectClass: person
        sn: Jensen
        # Base64 encoded JPEG photo
        jpegPhoto:: /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAAAAAQABAAD/2wBDABALD
         A4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQ
         ERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVG

        # Jennifer's Entry
        dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
        cn: Jennifer J Jensen
        cn: Jennifer Jensen
        objectClass: person
        sn: Jensen
        # JPEG photo from file
        jpegPhoto:< file:///path/to/file.jpeg
```

Notice that the `jpegPhoto` in Bjorn's entry is base 64 encoded and the `jpegPhoto` in Jennifer's entry is obtained from the location indicated by the URL.

**Note:** Trailing spaces are not trimmed from values in an LDIF file. Nor are multiple internal spaces compressed. If you don't  want them in your data, don't put them there.

# 11. Backends

Backends do the actual work of storing or retrieving data in response to LDAP requests. Backends may be compiled statically into *slapd*, or when module support is enabled, they may be dynamically loaded.

If your installation uses dynamic modules, you may need to add the relevant *moduleload* directives to the examples that follow. The name of the module for a backend is usually of the form:

```
        back_<backend name>.la
```

So for example, if you need to load the *mdb* backend, you would configure

```
        moduleload back_mdb.la
```

------

## 11.1. LDAP

### 11.1.1. Overview

The LDAP backend to *slapd*(8) is not an actual database;  instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming requests to another LDAP  server. While processing requests it will also chase referrals, so that  referrals are fully processed instead of being returned to the *slapd* client.

Sessions that explicitly *Bind* to the *back-ldap*  database always create their own private connection to the remote LDAP  server. Anonymous sessions will share a single anonymous connection to  the remote server. For sessions bound through other mechanisms, all  sessions with the same DN will share the same connection. This  connection pooling strategy can enhance the proxy's efficiency by  reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple  connections.

The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e. the  identity of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the remote  server, possibly in some modified form. For this purpose, the proxy  binds to the remote server with some administrative identity, and, if  required, authorizes the asserted identity.

It is heavily used by a lot of other [Backends](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/backends.html) and [Overlays](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/overlays.html).

### 11.1.2. back-ldap Configuration

As previously mentioned, *slapd-ldap(5)* is used behind the scenes by many other [Backends](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/backends.html) and [Overlays](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/overlays.html). Some of them merely provide a few configuration directive themselves,  but have available to the administrator the whole of the *slapd-ldap(5)* options.

For example, the [Translucent Proxy](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/overlays.html#Translucent Proxy), which retrieves entries from a remote LDAP server that can be partially overridden by the defined database, has only four specific *translucent-* directives, but can be configured using any of the normal *slapd-ldap(5)* options. See *slapo-translucent(5)* for details.

Other [Overlays](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/overlays.html) allow you to tag directives in front of a normal *slapd-ldap(5)* directive. For example, the *slapo-chain(5)* overlay does this:

*"There are very few chain overlay specific directives; however,  directives related to the instances of the ldap backend that may be  implicitly instantiated by the overlay may assume a special meaning when used in conjunction with this overlay.  They are described in  slapd-ldap(5), and they also need to be prefixed by chain-."*

You may have also seen the *slapd-ldap(5)* backend used and described in the Push Based [Replication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html) section of the guide.

It should therefore be obvious that the *slapd-ldap(5)* backend is extremely flexible and heavily used throughout the OpenLDAP Suite.

The following is a very simple example, but already the power of the *slapd-ldap(5)* backend is seen by use of a *uri list*:

```
        database        ldap
        suffix          "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn          "cn=slapd-ldap"
        uri             ldap://localhost/ ldap://remotehost ldap://remotehost2
```

The URI list is space or comma-separated. Whenever the server that  responds is not the first one in the list, the list is rearranged and  the responsive server is moved to the head, so that it will be first  contacted the next time a connection needs be created.

This feature can be used to provide a form of load balancing when using [Mirror mode replication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Mirror mode replication).

### 11.1.3. Further Information

*slapd-ldap*(5)

## 11.2. LDIF

### 11.2.1. Overview

The LDIF backend to *slapd*(8) is a basic storage backend that stores entries in text files in LDIF format, and exploits the  filesystem to create the tree structure of the database. It is intended  as a cheap, low performance easy to use backend.

When using the *cn=config* dynamic configuration database with persistent storage, the configuration data is stored using this backend. See *slapd-config*(5) for more information

### 11.2.2. back-ldif Configuration

Like many other backends, the LDIF backend can be instantiated with very few configuration lines:

```
        include ./schema/core.schema

        database  ldif
        directory ./ldif
        suffix    "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn    "cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootpw    LDIF
```

If we add the *dcObject* for *dc=suretecsystems,dc=com*, you can see how this is added behind the scenes on the file system:

```
   dn: dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
   objectClass: dcObject
   objectClass: organization
   dc: suretecsystems
   o: Suretec Systems Ltd
```

Now we add it to the directory:

```
   ldapadd -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -f suretec.ldif -D "cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" -w LDIF
   adding new entry "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
```

And inside `./ldif` we have:

```
   ls ./ldif
   dc=suretecsystems,dc=com.ldif
```

which again contains:

```
   cat ldif/dc\=suretecsystems\,dc\=com.ldif

   dn: dc=suretecsystems
   objectClass: dcObject
   objectClass: organization
   dc: suretecsystems
   o: Suretec Systems Ltd.
   structuralObjectClass: organization
   entryUUID: 2134b714-e3a1-102c-9a15-f96ee263886d
   creatorsName: cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
   createTimestamp: 20080711142643Z
   entryCSN: 20080711142643.661124Z#000000#000#000000
   modifiersName: cn=LDIF,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
   modifyTimestamp: 20080711142643Z
```

This is the complete format you would get when exporting your directory using `slapcat` etc.

### 11.2.3. Further Information

*slapd-ldif*(5)

------

## 11.3. LMDB

### 11.3.1. Overview

The *mdb* backend to *slapd*(8) is the recommended primary backend for a normal *slapd* database.  It uses OpenLDAP's own Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) library to store data and replaces the BerkeleyDB backends used in older OpenLDAP releases.

It supports indexing, it uses no caching, and requires no tuning to  deliver maximum search performance.  It is fully hierarchical and  supports subtree renames in constant time.

### 11.3.2. back-mdb Configuration

The *mdb* backend can be instantiated with very few configuration lines:

```
        include ./schema/core.schema

        database  mdb
        directory ./mdb
        suffix    "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootdn    "cn=mdb,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
        rootpw    mdb
        maxsize   1073741824
```

In addition to the usual parameters that a minimal configuration requires, the *mdb* backend requires a maximum size to be set. This should be the largest  that the database is ever anticipated to grow (in bytes). The filesystem must also provide enough free space to accommodate this size.

### 11.3.3. Further Information

*slapd-mdb*(5)

------

## 11.4. Metadirectory

### 11.4.1. Overview

The meta backend to *slapd*(8) performs basic LDAP proxying  with respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets". The  information contained in these servers can be presented as belonging to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).

A basic knowledge of the functionality of the *slapd-ldap*(5)  backend is recommended. This backend has been designed as an enhancement of the ldap backend. The two backends share many features (actually  they also share portions of code). While the ldap backend is intended to proxy operations directed to a single server, the meta backend is  mainly intended for proxying of multiple servers and possibly naming  context  masquerading.

These features, although useful in many scenarios, may result in  excessive overhead for some applications, so its use should be carefully considered.

### 11.4.2. back-meta Configuration

LATER

### 11.4.3. Further Information

*slapd-meta*(5)

------

## 11.5. Monitor

### 11.5.1. Overview

The monitor backend to *slapd*(8) is not an actual database;  if enabled, it is automatically generated and dynamically maintained by  slapd with information about the running status of the daemon.

To inspect all monitor information, issue a subtree search with base *cn=Monitor*, requesting that attributes "+" and "*" are returned. The monitor  backend produces mostly operational attributes, and LDAP only returns  operational attributes that are explicitly requested.  Requesting  attribute "+" is an extension which requests all operational attributes.

See the [Monitoring](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/monitoringslapd.html) section.

### 11.5.2. back-monitor Configuration

The monitor database can be instantiated only once, i.e. only one occurrence of "database monitor" can occur in the *slapd.conf(5)* file.  Also the suffix is automatically set to *"cn=Monitor"*.

You can however set a *rootdn* and *rootpw*. The following is all that is needed to instantiate a monitor backend:

```
        include ./schema/core.schema

        database monitor
        rootdn "cn=monitoring,cn=Monitor"
        rootpw monitoring
```

You can also apply Access Control to this database like any other database, for example:

```
        access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"
             by dn.exact="uid=Admin,dc=my,dc=org" write
             by users read
             by * none
```



------

**Note:** The `core.schema` must be loaded for the monitor database to work.

------



A small example of the data returned via *ldapsearch* would be:

```
        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -b 'cn=Monitor'
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=Monitor> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #

        # Monitor
        dn: cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorServer
        cn: Monitor
        description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
        description: This object contains information about this server.
        description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
         must be explicitly requested.

        # Backends, Monitor
        dn: cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorContainer
        cn: Backends
        description: This subsystem contains information about available backends.
```

Please see the [Monitoring](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/monitoringslapd.html) section for complete examples of information available via this backend.

### 11.5.3. Further Information

## 11.6. Null

### 11.6.1. Overview

The Null backend to *slapd*(8) is surely the most useful part of slapd:

- Searches return success but no entries.
- Compares return compareFalse.
- Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
- Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option "bind on" is given.
- The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are equally exciting.

Inspired by the `/dev/null` device.

### 11.6.2. back-null Configuration

This has to be one of the shortest configurations you'll ever do. In order to test this, your `slapd.conf` file would look like:

```
        database null
        suffix "cn=Nothing"
        bind on
```

*bind on* means:

*"Allow binds as any DN in this backend's suffix, with any password. The default is "off"."*

To test this backend with *ldapsearch*:

```
        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -D "uid=none,cn=Nothing" -w testing -b 'cn=Nothing'
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=Nothing> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #

        # search result
        search: 2
        result: 0 Success

        # numResponses: 1
```

### 11.6.3. Further Information

*slapd-null*(5)

------

## 11.7. Passwd

### 11.7.1. Overview

The PASSWD backend to *slapd*(8) serves up the user account information listed in the system *passwd*(5) file (defaulting to `/etc/passwd`).

This backend is provided for demonstration purposes only. The DN of each entry is "uid=<username>,<suffix>".

### 11.7.2. back-passwd Configuration

The configuration using `slapd.conf` a slightly longer, but not much. For example:

```
        include ./schema/core.schema

        database passwd
        suffix "cn=passwd"
```

Again, testing this with *ldapsearch* would result in something like:

```
        ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9011 -b 'cn=passwd'
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=passwd> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #

        # passwd
        dn: cn=passwd
        cn: passwd
        objectClass: organizationalUnit

        # root, passwd
        dn: uid=root,cn=passwd
        objectClass: person
        objectClass: uidObject
        uid: root
        cn: root
        sn: root
        description: root
```

### 11.7.3. Further Information

*slapd-passwd*(5)

------

## 11.8. Perl

### 11.8.1. Overview

The Perl backend to *slapd*(8) works by embedding a *perl*(1) interpreter into *slapd*(8). Any perl database section of the configuration file *slapd.conf*(5) must then specify what Perl module to use. Slapd then creates a new  Perl object that handles all the requests for that particular instance  of the backend.

### 11.8.3. Further Information

*slapd-perl*(5)

------

## 11.9. Relay

### 11.9.1. Overview

The primary purpose of this *slapd*(8) backend is to map a naming context defined in a database running in the same *slapd*(8) instance into a virtual naming context, with attributeType and  objectClass manipulation, if required. It requires the rwm overlay.

This backend and the above mentioned overlay are experimental.

### 11.9.2. back-relay Configuration

LATER

### 11.9.3. Further Information

*slapd-relay*(5)

------

## 11.10. SQL

### 11.10.1. Overview

The primary purpose of this *slapd*(8) backend is to PRESENT  information stored in some RDBMS as an LDAP subtree without any  programming (some SQL and maybe stored procedures can't be considered  programming, anyway ;).

That is, for example, when you (some ISP) have account information  you use in an RDBMS, and want to use modern solutions that expect such  information in LDAP (to authenticate users, make email lookups etc.). Or you want to synchronize or distribute information between different  sites/applications that use RDBMSes and/or LDAP. Or whatever else...

It is **NOT** designed as a general-purpose backend that uses  RDBMS instead of LMDB (as the standard back-mdb backend does), though it can be used as such with several limitations. Please see [LDAP vs RDBMS](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/intro.html#LDAP vs RDBMS) for discussion.

The idea is to use some meta-information to translate LDAP queries to SQL queries, leaving relational schema untouched, so that old  applications can continue using it without any modifications. This  allows SQL and LDAP applications to interoperate without replication,  and exchange data as needed.

The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational schema without having to change source (through that meta-information  mentioned). Also, it uses ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and is highly  configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes may use, so it may be used for  integration and distribution of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts  etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environments.

This backend is experimental and deprecated.

### 11.10.2. back-sql Configuration

This backend has to be one of the most abused and complex backends  there is. Therefore, we will go through a simple, small example that  comes with the OpenLDAP source and can be found in `servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/README`

For this example we will be using PostgreSQL.

First, we add to `/etc/odbc.ini` a block of the form:

```
        [example]                        <===
        Description         = Example for OpenLDAP's back-sql
        Driver              = PostgreSQL
        Trace               = No
        Database            = example    <===
        Servername          = localhost
        UserName            = manager    <===
        Password            = secret     <===
        Port                = 5432
        ;Protocol            = 6.4
        ReadOnly            = No
        RowVersioning       = No
        ShowSystemTables    = No
        ShowOidColumn       = No
        FakeOidIndex        = No
        ConnSettings        =
```

The relevant information for our test setup is highlighted with '<===' on the right above.

Next, we add to `/etc/odbcinst.ini` a block of the form:

```
        [PostgreSQL]
        Description     = ODBC for PostgreSQL
        Driver          = /usr/lib/libodbcpsql.so
        Setup           = /usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so
        FileUsage       = 1
```

We will presume you know how to create a database and user in  PostgreSQL and how to set a password. Also, we'll presume you can  populate the 'example' database you've just created with the following  files, as found in `servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/pgsql `

```
        backsql_create.sql, testdb_create.sql, testdb_data.sql, testdb_metadata.sql
```

Lastly, run the test:

```
        [root@localhost]# cd $SOURCES/tests
        [root@localhost]# SLAPD_USE_SQL=pgsql ./run sql-test000
```

Briefly, you should see something like (cut short for space):

```
        Cleaning up test run directory leftover from previous run.
        Running ./scripts/sql-test000-read...
        running defines.sh
        Starting slapd on TCP/IP port 9011...
        Testing SQL backend read operations...
        Waiting 5 seconds for slapd to start...
        Testing correct bind... dn:cn=Mitya Kovalev,dc=example,dc=com
        Testing incorrect bind (should fail)... ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)

        ......

        Filtering original ldif...
        Comparing filter output...
        >>>>> Test succeeded
```

The test is basically readonly; this can be performed by all RDBMSes (listed above).

There is another test, sql-test900-write, which is currently enabled only for PostgreSQL and IBM db2.

Using `sql-test000`, files in `servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/pgsql/` and the man page, you should be set.

# 12. Overlays

Overlays are software components that provide hooks to functions  analogous to those provided by backends, which can be stacked on top of  the backend calls and as callbacks on top of backend responses to alter  their behavior.

Overlays may be compiled statically into *slapd*, or when  module support is enabled, they may be dynamically loaded. Most of the  overlays are only allowed to be configured on individual databases.

Some can be stacked on the `frontend` as well, for global use. This means that they can be executed after a request is parsed and  validated, but right before the appropriate database is selected. The  main purpose is to affect operations regardless of the database they  will be handled by, and, in some cases, to influence the selection of  the database by massaging the request DN.

Essentially, overlays represent a means to:

- customize the behavior of existing backends without changing the  backend code and without requiring one to write a new custom backend  with complete functionality
- write functionality of general usefulness that can be applied to different backend types

When using *slapd.conf*(5), overlays that are configured  before any other databases are considered global, as mentioned above. In fact they are implicitly stacked on top of the `frontend` database. They can also be explicitly configured as such:

```
        database frontend
        overlay <overlay name>
```

Overlays are usually documented by separate specific man pages in section 5; the naming convention is

```
        slapo-<overlay name>
```

All distributed core overlays have a man page. Feel free to  contribute to any, if you think there is anything missing in describing  the behavior of the component and the implications of all the related  configuration directives.

Official overlays are located in

```
        servers/slapd/overlays/
```

That directory also contains the file slapover.txt, which describes  the rationale of the overlay implementation, and may serve as a  guideline for the development of custom overlays.

Contribware overlays are located in

```
        contrib/slapd-modules/<overlay name>/
```

along with other types of run-time loadable components; they are officially distributed, but not maintained by the project.

All the current overlays in OpenLDAP are listed and described in detail in the following sections.

------

## 12.1. Access Logging

### 12.1.1. Overview

This overlay can record accesses to a given backend database on another database.

This allows all of the activity on a given database to be reviewed  using arbitrary LDAP queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files. Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of  operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log records  from the logging database. Log records are stored with audit schema to  assure their readability whether viewed as LDIF or in raw form.

It is also used for delta-syncrepl replication



------

**Note:** An accesslog database is unique to a given provider. It should never be replicated.

------



### 12.1.2. Access Logging Configuration

The following is a basic example that implements Access Logging:

```
        database mdb
        suffix dc=example,dc=com
        ...
        overlay accesslog
        logdb cn=log
        logops writes reads
        logold (objectclass=person)

        database mdb
        suffix cn=log
        ...
        index reqStart eq
        access to *
          by dn.base="cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" read
```

The following is an example used for delta-syncrepl replication:

```
        database mdb
        suffix cn=accesslog
        directory /usr/local/var/openldap-accesslog
        rootdn cn=accesslog
        index default eq
        index entryCSN,objectClass,reqEnd,reqResult,reqStart,reqDN
```

Accesslog overlay definitions for the primary db

```
        database mdb
        suffix dc=example,dc=com
        ...
        overlay accesslog
        logdb cn=accesslog
        logops writes
        logsuccess TRUE
        # scan the accesslog DB every day, and purge entries older than 7 days
        logpurge 07+00:00 01+00:00
```

An example search result against **cn=accesslog** might look like:

```
        [ghenry@suretec ghenry]# ldapsearch -x -b cn=accesslog
        # extended LDIF
        #
        # LDAPv3
        # base <cn=accesslog> with scope subtree
        # filter: (objectclass=*)
        # requesting: ALL
        #

        # accesslog
        dn: cn=accesslog
        objectClass: auditContainer
        cn: accesslog

        # 20080110163829.000004Z, accesslog
        dn: reqStart=20080110163829.000004Z,cn=accesslog
        objectClass: auditModify
        reqStart: 20080110163829.000004Z
        reqEnd: 20080110163829.000005Z
        reqType: modify
        reqSession: 196696
        reqAuthzID: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        reqDN: uid=suretec-46022f8$,ou=Users,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        reqResult: 0
        reqMod: sambaPwdCanChange:- ###CENSORED###
        reqMod: sambaPwdCanChange:+ ###CENSORED###
        reqMod: sambaNTPassword:- ###CENSORED###
        reqMod: sambaNTPassword:+ ###CENSORED###
        reqMod: sambaPwdLastSet:- ###CENSORED###
        reqMod: sambaPwdLastSet:+ ###CENSORED###
        reqMod: entryCSN:= 20080110163829.095157Z#000000#000#000000
        reqMod: modifiersName:= cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
        reqMod: modifyTimestamp:= 20080110163829Z

        # search result
        search: 2
        result: 0 Success

        # numResponses: 3
        # numEntries: 2
```

## 12.2. Audit Logging

The Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a given backend database to a specified log file.

### 12.2.1. Overview

If the need arises whereby changes need to be logged as standard LDIF, then the auditlog overlay **slapo-auditlog (5)** can be used. Full examples are available in the man page **slapo-auditlog (5)**

### 12.2.2. Audit Logging Configuration

If the directory is running vi `slapd.d`, then the following LDIF could be used to add the overlay to the overlay list in **cn=config** and set what file the LDIF gets logged to (adjust to suit)

```
       dn: olcOverlay=auditlog,olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config
       changetype: add
       objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
       objectClass: olcAuditLogConfig
       olcOverlay: auditlog
       olcAuditlogFile: /tmp/auditlog.ldif
```

In this example for testing, we are logging changes to `/tmp/auditlog.ldif`

A typical LDIF file created by **slapo-auditlog(5)** would look like:

```
       # add 1196797576 dc=suretecsystems,dc=com cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       dn: dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       changetype: add
       objectClass: dcObject
       objectClass: organization
       dc: suretecsystems
       o: Suretec Systems Ltd.
       structuralObjectClass: organization
       entryUUID: 1606f8f8-f06e-1029-8289-f0cc9d81e81a
       creatorsName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       modifiersName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       createTimestamp: 20051123130912Z
       modifyTimestamp: 20051123130912Z
       entryCSN: 20051123130912.000000Z#000001#000#000000
       auditContext: cn=accesslog
       # end add 1196797576

       # add 1196797577 dc=suretecsystems,dc=com cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       dn: ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       changetype: add
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: organizationalUnit
       ou: Groups
       structuralObjectClass: organizationalUnit
       entryUUID: 160aaa2a-f06e-1029-828a-f0cc9d81e81a
       creatorsName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       modifiersName: cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       createTimestamp: 20051123130912Z
       modifyTimestamp: 20051123130912Z
       entryCSN: 20051123130912.000000Z#000002#000#000000
       # end add 1196797577
```

## 12.3. Chaining

### 12.3.1. Overview

The chain overlay provides basic chaining capability to the underlying database.

What is chaining? It indicates the capability of a DSA to follow  referrals on behalf of the client, so that distributed systems are  viewed as a single virtual DSA by clients that are otherwise unable to  "chase" (i.e. follow) referrals by themselves.

The chain overlay is built on top of the ldap backend; it is compiled by default when **--enable-ldap**.

### 12.3.2. Chaining Configuration

In order to demonstrate how this overlay works, we shall discuss a  typical scenario which might be one provider server and three Syncrepl  replicas.

On each replica, add this near the top of the *slapd.conf*(5) file (global), before any database definitions:

```
        overlay                    chain
        chain-uri                  "ldap://ldapprovider.example.com"
        chain-idassert-bind        bindmethod="simple"
                                   binddn="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
                                   credentials="<secret>"
                                   mode="self"
        chain-tls                  start
        chain-return-error         TRUE
```

Add this below your *syncrepl* statement:

```
        updateref                  "ldap://ldapprovider.example.com/"
```

The **chain-tls** statement enables TLS from the replica to the  ldap provider. The DITs are exactly the same between these machines,  therefore whatever user bound to the replica will also exist on the  provider. If that DN does not have update privileges on the provider,  nothing will happen.

You will need to restart the replica after these *slapd.conf* changes. Then, if you are using *loglevel stats* (256), you can monitor an *ldapmodify* on the replica and the provider. (If you're using *cn=config* no restart is required.)

Now start an *ldapmodify* on the replica and watch the logs. You should expect something like:

```
        Sep  6 09:27:25 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 ACCEPT from IP=143.199.102.216:45181 (IP=143.199.102.216:389)
        Sep  6 09:27:25 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=0 STARTTLS
        Sep  6 09:27:25 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=0 RESULT oid= err=0 text=
        Sep  6 09:27:25 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 TLS established tls_ssf=256 ssf=256
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 BIND dn="uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" method=128
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 BIND dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" mech=SIMPLE ssf=0
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=1 RESULT tag=97 err=0 text=
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 MOD dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 MOD attr=mail
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=2 RESULT tag=103 err=0 text=
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 op=3 UNBIND
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: conn=11 fd=31 closed
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: LDAP_RES_SEARCH_ENTRY(LDAP_SYNC_MODIFY)
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: be_search (0)
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        Sep  6 09:27:28 replica1 slapd[29274]: syncrepl_entry: be_modify (0)
```

And on the provider you will see this:

```
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapprovider slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 PROXYAUTHZ dn="uid=user1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapprovider slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 MOD dn="uid=user1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapprovider slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 MOD attr=mail
        Sep  6 09:23:57 ldapprovider slapd[2961]: conn=55902 op=3 RESULT tag=103 err=0 text=
```



------

**Note:** You can clearly see the PROXYAUTHZ line on the  provider, indicating the proper identity assertion for the update on the provider. Also note the replica immediately receiving the Syncrepl  update from the provider.

------



### 12.3.3. Handling Chaining Errors

By default, if chaining fails, the original referral is returned to  the client under the assumption that the client might want to try and  follow the referral.

With the following directive however, if the chaining fails at the provider side, the actual error is returned to the client.

```
        chain-return-error TRUE
```

### 12.3.4. Read-Back of Chained Modifications

Occasionally, applications want to read back the data that they just  wrote. If a modification requested to a shadow server was silently  chained to its provider, an immediate read could result in receiving  data not yet synchronized. In those cases, clients should use the **dontusecopy** control to ensure they are directed to the authoritative source for that piece of data.

This control usually causes a referral to the actual source of the data to be returned.  However, when the *slapo-chain(5)* overlay is used, it intercepts the referral being returned in response to the **dontusecopy** control, and tries to fetch the requested data.

## 12.4. Constraints

### 12.4.1. Overview

This overlay enforces a regular expression constraint on all values  of specified attributes during an LDAP modify request that contains add  or modify commands. It is used to enforce a more rigorous syntax when  the underlying attribute syntax is too general.

### 12.4.2. Constraint Configuration

Configuration via *slapd.conf*(5) would look like:

```
        overlay constraint
        constraint_attribute mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
        constraint_attribute title uri
        ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)
```

A specification like the above would reject any *mail* attribute which did not look like *<alphanumeric string>@mydomain.com*.

It would also reject any title attribute whose values were not listed in the title attribute of any *titleCatalog* entries in the given scope.

An example for use with *cn=config*:

```
       dn: olcOverlay=constraint,olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config
       changetype: add
       objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
       objectClass: olcConstraintConfig
       olcOverlay: constraint
       olcConstraintAttribute: mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
       olcConstraintAttribute: title uri ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)
```

## 12.5. Dynamic Directory Services

### 12.5.1. Overview

The *dds* overlay to *slapd*(8) implements dynamic objects as per [RFC2589](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2589.txt). The name *dds* stands for Dynamic Directory Services. It allows to define dynamic objects, characterized by the *dynamicObject* objectClass.

Dynamic objects have a limited lifetime, determined by a time-to-live (TTL) that can be refreshed by means of a specific refresh extended  operation. This operation allows to set the Client Refresh Period (CRP), namely the period between refreshes that is required to preserve the  dynamic object from expiration. The expiration time is computed by  adding the requested TTL to the current time. When dynamic objects reach the end of their lifetime without being further refreshed, they are  automatically *deleted*. There is no guarantee of immediate deletion, so clients should not count on it.

### 12.5.2. Dynamic Directory Service Configuration

A usage of dynamic objects might be to implement dynamic meetings; in this case, all the participants to the meeting are allowed to refresh  the meeting object, but only the creator can delete it (otherwise it  will be deleted when the TTL expires).

If we add the overlay to an example database, specifying a Max TTL of 1 day, a min of 10 seconds, with a default TTL of 1 hour. We'll also  specify an interval of 120 (less than 60s might be too small) seconds  between expiration checks and a tolerance of 5 second (lifetime of a  dynamic object will be *entryTtl + tolerance*).

```
       overlay dds
       dds-max-ttl     1d
       dds-min-ttl     10s
       dds-default-ttl 1h
       dds-interval    120s
       dds-tolerance   5s
```

and add an index:

```
       entryExpireTimestamp
```

Creating a meeting is as simple as adding the following:

```
       dn: cn=OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting,ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com
       objectClass: groupOfNames
       objectClass: dynamicObject
       cn: OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting
       member: uid=ghenry,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
       member: uid=hyc,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
```

#### 12.5.2.1. Dynamic Directory Service ACLs

Allow users to start a meeting and to join it; restrict refresh to the *member*; restrict delete to the creator:

```
       access to attrs=userPassword
          by self write
          by * read

       access to dn.base="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=children
            by users write

       access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=entry
            by dnattr=creatorsName write
            by * read

       access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=participant
            by dnattr=creatorsName write
            by users selfwrite
            by * read

       access to dn.onelevel="ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com"
                 attrs=entryTtl
            by dnattr=member manage
            by * read
```

In simple terms, the user who created the *OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting* can add new attendees, refresh the meeting using (basically complete control):

```
       ldapexop -x -H ldap://ldaphost "refresh" "cn=OpenLDAP Documentation Meeting,ou=Meetings,dc=example,dc=com" "120" -D "uid=ghenry,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -W
```

Any user can join the meeting, but not add another attendee, but they can refresh the meeting. The ACLs above are quite straight forward to  understand.

## 12.6. Dynamic Groups

### 12.6.1. Overview

This overlay extends the Compare operation to detect members of a  dynamic group. This overlay is now deprecated as all of its functions  are available using the [Dynamic Lists](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/overlays.html#Dynamic Lists) overlay.

### 12.6.2. Dynamic Group Configuration

------

## 12.7. Dynamic Lists

### 12.7.1. Overview

This overlay allows expansion of dynamic groups and lists. Instead of having the group members or list attributes hard coded, this overlay  allows us to define an LDAP search whose results will make up the group  or list.

### 12.7.2. Dynamic List Configuration

This module can behave both as a dynamic list and dynamic group, depending on the configuration. The syntax is as follows:

```
       overlay dynlist
       dynlist-attrset <group-oc> <URL-ad> [member-ad]
```

The parameters to the `dynlist-attrset` directive have the following meaning:

- `<group-oc>`: specifies which object class triggers the subsequent LDAP search. Whenever an entry with this object class is  retrieved, the search is performed.
- `<URL-ad>`: is the name of the attribute which holds the search URI. It has to be a subtype of `labeledURI`. The attributes and values present in the search result are added to the entry unless `member-ad` is used (see below).
- `member-ad`: if present, changes the overlay behavior  into a dynamic group. Instead of inserting the results of the search in  the entry, the distinguished name of the results are added as values of  this attribute.

Here is an example which will allow us to have an email alias which  automatically expands to all user's emails according to our LDAP filter:

In *slapd.conf*(5):

```
       overlay dynlist
       dynlist-attrset nisMailAlias labeledURI
```

This means that whenever an entry which has the `nisMailAlias` object class is retrieved, the search specified in the `labeledURI` attribute is performed.

Let's say we have this entry in our directory:

```
       cn=all,ou=aliases,dc=example,dc=com
       cn: all
       objectClass: nisMailAlias
       labeledURI: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?one?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)
```

If this entry is retrieved, the search specified in `labeledURI` will be performed and the results will be added to the entry just as if they have always been there. In this case, the search filter selects  all entries directly under `ou=People` that have the `inetOrgPerson` object class and retrieves the `mail` attribute, if it exists.

This is what gets added to the entry when we have two users under `ou=People` that match the filter:



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/allmail-en.png)



Figure X.Y: Dynamic List for all emails

The configuration for a dynamic group is similar. Let's see an example which would automatically populate an `allusers` group with all the user accounts in the directory.

In `slapd.conf`(5):

```
       include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
       ...
       overlay dynlist
       dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs labeledURI member
```



------

**Note:** We must include the `dyngroup.schema` file that defines the `groupOfURLs` objectClass used in this example.

------



Let's apply it to the following entry:

```
       cn=allusers,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
       cn: all
       objectClass: groupOfURLs
       labeledURI: ldap:///ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)
```

The behavior is similar to the dynamic list configuration we had before: whenever an entry with the `groupOfURLs` object class is retrieved, the search specified in the `labeledURI` attribute is performed. But this time, only the distinguished names of the results are added, and as values of the `member` attribute.

This is what we get:



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/allusersgroup-en.png)



Figure X.Y: Dynamic Group for all users

Note that a side effect of this scheme of dynamic groups is that the  members need to be specified as full DNs. So, if you are planning in  using this for `posixGroup`s, be sure to use RFC2307bis and some attribute which can hold distinguished names. The `memberUid` attribute used in the `posixGroup` object class can hold only names, not DNs, and is therefore not suitable for dynamic groups.

## 12.8. Reverse Group Membership Maintenance

### 12.8.1. Overview

In some scenarios, it may be desirable for a client to be able to  determine which groups an entry is a member of, without performing an  additional search. Examples of this are applications using the DIT for access control based on group authorization.

The **memberof** overlay updates an attribute (by default **memberOf**) whenever changes occur to the membership attribute (by default **member**) of entries of the objectclass (by default **groupOfNames**) configured to trigger updates.

Thus, it provides maintenance of the list of groups an entry is a  member of, when usual maintenance of groups is done by modifying the  members on the group entry.

### 12.8.2. Member Of Configuration

The typical use of this overlay requires just enabling the overlay  for a specific database. For example, with the following minimal  slapd.conf:

```
        include /usr/share/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include /usr/share/openldap/schema/cosine.schema

        authz-regexp "gidNumber=0\\\+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth"
                "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
        database        mdb
        suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
        rootdn          "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
        rootpw          secret
        directory       /var/lib/ldap2.5
        checkpoint 256 5
        index   objectClass   eq
        index   uid           eq,sub

        overlay memberof
```

adding the following ldif:

```
        cat memberof.ldif
        dn: dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: domain
        dc: example

        dn: ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: organizationalUnit
        ou: Group

        dn: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: organizationalUnit
        ou: People

        dn: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: account
        uid: test1

        dn: cn=testgroup,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
        objectclass: groupOfNames
        cn: testgroup
        member: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
```

Results in the following output from a search on the test1 user:

```
 # ldapsearch -LL -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// "(uid=test1)" -b dc=example,dc=com memberOf
 SASL/EXTERNAL authentication started
 SASL username: gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
 SASL SSF: 0
 version: 1

 dn: uid=test1,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
 memberOf: cn=testgroup,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
```

Note that the **memberOf** attribute is an operational attribute, so it must be requested explicitly.

## 12.9. The Proxy Cache Engine

LDAP servers typically hold one or more subtrees of a DIT. Replica (or shadow) servers hold shadow copies of entries held by one  or more provider servers.  Changes are propagated from the provider  server to replica servers using LDAP Sync replication.  An LDAP cache is a special type of replica which holds entries corresponding to search  filters instead of subtrees.

### 12.9.1. Overview

The proxy cache extension of slapd is designed to improve the  responsiveness of the ldap and meta backends. It handles a search  request (query) by first determining whether it is contained in any  cached search filter. Contained requests are answered from the proxy  cache's local database. Other requests are passed on to the underlying  ldap or meta backend and processed as usual.

E.g. `(shoesize>=9)` is contained in `(shoesize>=8)` and `(sn=Richardson)` is contained in `(sn=Richards*)`

Correct matching rules and syntaxes are used while comparing  assertions for query containment. To simplify the query containment  problem, a list of cacheable "templates" (defined below) is specified at configuration time. A query is cached or answered only if it belongs to one of these templates. The entries corresponding to cached queries are stored in the proxy cache local database while its associated meta  information (filter, scope, base, attributes) is stored in main memory.

A template is a prototype for generating LDAP search requests.  Templates are described by a prototype search filter and a list of  attributes which are required in queries generated from the template.  The representation for prototype filter is similar to [RFC4515](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4515.txt), except that the assertion values are missing. Examples of prototype  filters are: (sn=),(&(sn=)(givenname=)) which are instantiated by  search filters (sn=Doe) and (&(sn=Doe)(givenname=John))  respectively.

The cache replacement policy removes the least recently used (LRU)  query and entries belonging to only that query. Queries are allowed a  maximum time to live (TTL) in the cache thus providing weak consistency. A background task periodically checks the cache for expired queries and removes them.

The Proxy Cache paper (http://www.openldap.org/pub/kapurva/proxycaching.pdf) provides design and implementation details.

### 12.9.2. Proxy Cache Configuration

The cache configuration specific directives described below must appear after a `overlay pcache` directive within a `"database meta"` or `"database ldap"` section of the server's *slapd.conf*(5) file.

#### 12.9.2.1. Setting cache parameters

```
 pcache <DB> <maxentries> <nattrsets> <entrylimit> <period>
```

This directive enables proxy caching and sets general cache  parameters.  The <DB> parameter specifies which underlying  database is to be used to hold cached entries.  It should be set to `mdb`.  The <maxentries> parameter specifies the total number of entries which may be held in the cache.  The <nattrsets> parameter  specifies the total number of attribute sets (as specified by the `pcacheAttrset` directive) that may be defined.  The <entrylimit> parameter  specifies the maximum number of entries in a cacheable query.  The  <period> specifies the consistency check period (in seconds).  In  each period, queries with expired TTLs are removed.

#### 12.9.2.2. Defining attribute sets

```
 pcacheAttrset <index> <attrs...>
```

Used to associate a set of attributes to an index. Each attribute set is associated with an index number from 0 to <numattrsets>-1.  These indices are used by the pcacheTemplate directive to define  cacheable templates.

#### 12.9.2.3. Specifying cacheable templates

```
 pcacheTemplate <prototype_string> <attrset_index> <TTL>
```

Specifies a cacheable template and the "time to live" (in sec)  <TTL> for queries belonging to the template. A template is  described by its prototype filter string and set of required attributes  identified by <attrset_index>.

#### 12.9.2.4. Example for slapd.conf

An example *slapd.conf*(5) database section for a caching server which proxies for the `"dc=example,dc=com"` subtree held at server `ldap.example.com`.

```
        database        ldap
        suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
        rootdn          "dc=example,dc=com"
        uri             ldap://ldap.example.com/
        overlay pcache
        pcache         mdb 100000 1 1000 100
        pcacheAttrset  0 mail postaladdress telephonenumber
        pcacheTemplate (sn=) 0 3600
        pcacheTemplate (&(sn=)(givenName=)) 0 3600
        pcacheTemplate (&(departmentNumber=)(secretary=*)) 0 3600

        cachesize 20
        directory ./testrun/db.2.a
        index       objectClass eq
        index       cn,sn,uid,mail  pres,eq,sub
```

#### 12.9.2.5. Example for slapd-config

The same example as a LDIF file for back-config for a caching server which proxies for the `"dc=example,dc=com"` subtree held at server `ldap.example.com`.

```
   dn: olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
   objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
   objectClass: olcLDAPConfig
   olcDatabase: {2}ldap
   olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
   olcRootDN: dc=example,dc=com
   olcDbURI: "ldap://ldap.example.com"

   dn: olcOverlay={0}pcache,olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
   objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
   objectClass: olcPcacheConfig
   olcOverlay: {0}pcache
   olcPcache: mdb 100000 1 1000 100
   olcPcacheAttrset: 0 mail postalAddress telephoneNumber
   olcPcacheTemplate: "(sn=)" 0 3600 0 0 0
   olcPcacheTemplate: "(&(sn=)(givenName=))" 0 3600 0 0 0
   olcPcacheTemplate: "(&(departmentNumber=)(secretary=))" 0 3600

   dn: olcDatabase={0}mdb,olcOverlay={0}pcache,olcDatabase={2}ldap,cn=config
   objectClass: olcMdbConfig
   objectClass: olcPcacheDatabase
   olcDatabase: {0}mdb
   olcDbDirectory: ./testrun/db.2.a
   olcDbCacheSize: 20
   olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
   olcDbIndex: cn,sn,uid,mail  pres,eq,sub
```

##### 12.9.2.5.1. Cacheable Queries

A LDAP search query is cacheable when its filter matches one of the  templates as defined in the "pcacheTemplate" statements and when it  references only the attributes specified in the corresponding attribute  set. In the example above the attribute set number 0 defines that only  the attributes: `mail postaladdress telephonenumber` are cached for the following pcacheTemplates.

##### 12.9.2.5.2. Examples:

```
        Filter: (&(sn=Richard*)(givenName=jack))
        Attrs: mail telephoneNumber
```

is cacheable, because it matches the template `(&(sn=)(givenName=))` and its attributes are contained in pcacheAttrset 0.

```
        Filter: (&(sn=Richard*)(telephoneNumber))
        Attrs: givenName
```

is not cacheable, because the filter does not match the template, nor is the attribute givenName stored in the cache

```
        Filter: (|(sn=Richard*)(givenName=jack))
        Attrs: mail telephoneNumber
```

is not cacheable, because the filter does not match the template ( logical OR "|" condition instead of logical AND "&" )

## 12.10. Password Policies

### 12.10.1. Overview

This overlay follows the specifications contained in the draft RFC  titled draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-09. While the draft itself is  expired, it has been implemented in several directory servers, including slapd. Nonetheless, it is important to note that it is a draft, meaning that it is subject to change and is a work-in-progress.

The key abilities of the password policy overlay are as follows:

- Enforce a minimum length for new passwords
- Make sure passwords are not changed too frequently
- Cause passwords to expire, provide warnings before they need to be changed, and allow a fixed number of 'grace' logins to allow them to be changed after they have expired
- Maintain a history of passwords to prevent password re-use
- Prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures
- Force a password to be changed at the next authentication
- Set an administrative lock on an account
- Support multiple password policies on a default or a per-object basis.
- Perform arbitrary quality checks using an external loadable module. This is a non-standard extension of the draft RFC.

### 12.10.2. Password Policy Configuration

Instantiate the module in the database where it will be used, after  adding the new ppolicy schema and loading the ppolicy module. The  following example shows the ppolicy module being added to the database  that handles the naming context "dc=example,dc=com". In this example we  are also specifying the DN of a policy object to use if none other is  specified in a user's object.

```
       database mdb
       suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
       [...additional database configuration directives go here...]

       overlay ppolicy
       ppolicy_default "cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com"
```

Now we need a container for the policy objects. In our example the  password policy objects are going to be placed in a section of the tree  called "ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com":

```
       dn: ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com
       objectClass: organizationalUnit
       objectClass: top
       ou: policies
```

The default policy object that we are creating defines the following policies:

- The user is allowed to change his own password. Note that the  directory ACLs for this attribute can also affect this ability  (pwdAllowUserChange: TRUE).
- The name of the password attribute is "userPassword"  (pwdAttribute: userPassword). Note that this is the only value that is  accepted by OpenLDAP for this attribute.
- The server will check the syntax of the password. If the server is unable to check the syntax (i.e., it was hashed or otherwise encoded by the client) it will return an error refusing the password  (pwdCheckQuality: 2).
- When a client includes the Password Policy Request control with a bind request, the server will respond with a password expiration  warning if it is going to expire in ten minutes or less  (pwdExpireWarning: 600). The warnings themselves are returned in a  Password Policy Response control.
- When the password for a DN has expired, the server will allow five additional "grace" logins (pwdGraceAuthNLimit: 5).
- The server will maintain a history of the last five passwords that were used for a DN (pwdInHistory: 5).
- The server will lock the account after the maximum number of failed bind attempts has been exceeded (pwdLockout: TRUE).
- When the server has locked an account, the server will keep it locked until an administrator unlocks it (pwdLockoutDuration: 0)
- The server will reset its failed bind count after a period of 30 seconds.
- Passwords will not expire (pwdMaxAge: 0).
- Passwords can be changed as often as desired (pwdMinAge: 0).
- Passwords must be at least 5 characters in length (pwdMinLength: 5).
- The password does not need to be changed at the first bind or  when the administrator has reset the password (pwdMustChange: FALSE)
- The current password does not need to be included with password change requests (pwdSafeModify: FALSE)
- The server will only allow five failed binds in a row for a particular DN (pwdMaxFailure: 5).

The actual policy would be:

```
       dn: cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com
       cn: default
       objectClass: pwdPolicy
       objectClass: namedPolicy
       objectClass: top
       pwdAllowUserChange: TRUE
       pwdAttribute: userPassword
       pwdCheckQuality: 2
       pwdExpireWarning: 600
       pwdFailureCountInterval: 30
       pwdGraceAuthNLimit: 5
       pwdInHistory: 5
       pwdLockout: TRUE
       pwdLockoutDuration: 0
       pwdMaxAge: 0
       pwdMaxFailure: 5
       pwdMinAge: 0
       pwdMinLength: 5
       pwdMustChange: FALSE
       pwdSafeModify: FALSE
```

You can create additional policy objects as needed.

The namedPolicy object class is present because the policy entry requires a structural object class.

There are two ways password policy can be applied to individual objects:

1. The pwdPolicySubentry in a user's object - If a user's object has a pwdPolicySubEntry attribute specifying the DN of a policy object, then  the policy defined by that object is applied.
2. Default password policy - If there is no specific  pwdPolicySubentry set for an object, and the password policy module was  configured with the DN of a default policy object and if that object  exists, then the policy defined in that object is applied.

Please see *slapo-ppolicy(5)* for a complete explanation of its features.

A guiding philosophy for OpenLDAP and directory servers in general  has been that they always hand back exactly what they were given,  without modification. For example, if the cn attribute of an object was  set to fOObaR, the server will return that exact string during a search. Values of attributes of a sensitive nature, such as userPassword, are  often hashed to conceal their values. Since the userPassword values are  used internally by the directory server to authenticate users, any hash  algorithm that is applied to the value must be compatible with the  directory server. Historically this problem has been solved by making  the LDAP client application be able to hash the userPassword attribute  value in a way that is compatible with the directory server, but this  solution has the obvious drawback of requiring tight coupling between  the LDAP client and server, and limits the choices of usable hashing  algorithms to those that are accommodated by both. This is clearly a  sub-optimal solution.

In 2001 RFC 3062 became a standard that specified an LDAP extended  operation for cases like this. Extended operations are not bound by the  return-what-you-are-given philosophy and so are free to do things to  attribute values that the add and modify operations cannot. The change  password extended operation accepts a plaintext password and hashes it  based on a specification that is contained in the server. This allows  the server to be in control of the hashing algorithm which, in turn,  ensures that any hashes applied to userPassword attribute values will  not prevent users from being authenticated.

The password policy module's ppolicy_hash_cleartext flag addresses  this problem by intercepting LDAP modify operations that include the  userPassword attribute and converting them to change password extended  operations so they can be hashed according to the specification  contained in slapd's configuration. When this flag is set, LDAP  applications that modify the userPassword attribute can send the  password in cleartext form to the server using a standard LDAP modify  command and the server will hash the value according to the  password-hash directive before storing it. It goes without saying that  steps need to be taken to protect the cleartext password in transit,  such as using SSL, TLS, or some other link encryption method.

The following example shows the ppolicy module configured to hash cleartext passwords:

```
       database mdb
       suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
       [...additional database configuration directives go here...]

       overlay ppolicy
       ppolicy_default "cn=default,ou=policies,dc=example,dc=com"
       ppolicy_hash_cleartext
```

## 12.11. Referential Integrity

### 12.11.1. Overview

This overlay can be used with a backend database such as slapd-mdb(5) to maintain the cohesiveness of a schema which utilizes reference  attributes.

Whenever a *modrdn* or *delete* is performed, that is,  when an entry's DN is renamed or an entry is removed, the server will  search the directory for references to this DN (in selected attributes:  see below) and update them accordingly. If it was a *delete* operation, the reference is deleted. If it was a *modrdn* operation, then the reference is updated with the new DN.

For example, a very common administration task is to maintain group  membership lists, specially when users are removed from the directory.  When an user account is deleted or renamed, all groups this user is a  member of have to be updated. LDAP administrators usually have scripts  for that. But we can use the `refint` overlay to automate this  task. In this example, if the user is removed from the directory, the  overlay will take care to remove the user from all the groups he/she was a member of. No more scripting for this.

### 12.11.2. Referential Integrity Configuration

The configuration for this overlay is as follows:

```
       overlay refint
       refint_attributes <attribute [attribute ...]>
       refint_nothing <string>
```

- `refint_attributes`: this parameter specifies a space  separated list of attributes which will have the referential integrity  maintained. When an entry is removed or has its DN renamed, the server  will do an internal search for any of the `refint_attributes` that point to the affected DN and update them accordingly. IMPORTANT: the attributes listed here must have the `distinguishedName` syntax, that is, hold DNs as values.
- `refint_nothing`: some times, while trying to maintain  the referential integrity, the server has to remove the last attribute  of its kind from an entry. This may be prohibited by the schema: for  example, the `groupOfNames` object class requires at least one member. In these cases, the server will add the attribute value specified in `refint_nothing` to the entry.

To illustrate this overlay, we will use the group membership scenario.

In `slapd.conf`:

```
       overlay refint
       refint_attributes member
       refint_nothing "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
```

This configuration tells the overlay to maintain the referential integrity of the `member` attribute. This attribute is used in the `groupOfNames` object class which always needs a member, so we add the `refint_nothing` directive to fill in the group with a standard member should all the members vanish.

If we have the following group membership, the refint overlay will automatically remove `john` from the group if his entry is removed from the directory:



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/refint.png)



Figure X.Y: Maintaining referential integrity in groups

Notice that if we rename (`modrdn`) the `john` entry to, say, `jsmith`, the refint overlay will also rename the reference in the `member` attribute, so the group membership stays correct.

If we removed all users from the directory who are a member of this  group, then the end result would be a single member in the group: `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com`. This is the `refint_nothing` parameter kicking into action so that the schema is not violated.

The *rootdn* must be set for the database as refint runs as the *rootdn* to gain access to make its updates.  The *rootpw* does not need to be set.

## 12.12. Return Code

### 12.12.1. Overview

This overlay is useful to test the behavior of clients when  server-generated erroneous and/or unusual responses occur, for example;  error codes, referrals, excessive response times and so on.

This would be classed as a debugging tool whilst developing client software or additional Overlays.

For detailed information, please see the *slapo-retcode(5)* man page.

### 12.12.2. Return Code Configuration

The retcode overlay utilizes the "return code" schema described in  the man page. This schema is specifically designed for use with this  overlay and is not intended to be used otherwise.



------

**Note:** The necessary schema is loaded automatically by the overlay.

------



An example configuration might be:

```
       overlay         retcode
       retcode-parent  "ou=RetCodes,dc=example,dc=com"
       include         ./retcode.conf

       retcode-item    "cn=Unsolicited"                0x00 unsolicited="0"
       retcode-item    "cn=Notice of Disconnect"       0x00 unsolicited="1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20036"
       retcode-item    "cn=Pre-disconnect"             0x34 flags="pre-disconnect"
       retcode-item    "cn=Post-disconnect"            0x34 flags="post-disconnect"
```



------

**Note:** *retcode.conf* can be found in the openldap source at: `tests/data/retcode.conf`

------



An excerpt of a `retcode.conf` would be something like:

```
       retcode-item    "cn=success"                            0x00

       retcode-item    "cn=success w/ delay"                   0x00    sleeptime=2

       retcode-item    "cn=operationsError"                    0x01

## 12.13. Rewrite/Remap

### 12.13.1. Overview

It performs basic DN/data rewrite and objectClass/attributeType  mapping. Its usage is mostly intended to provide virtual views of  existing data either remotely, in conjunction with the proxy backend  described in *slapd-ldap(5)*, or locally, in conjunction with the relay backend described in *slapd-relay(5)*.

This overlay is extremely configurable and advanced, therefore recommended reading is the *slapo-rwm(5)* man page.

## 12.14. Sync Provider

### 12.14.1. Overview

This overlay implements the provider-side support for the LDAP Content Synchronization ([RFC4533](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt)) as well as syncrepl replication support, including persistent search functionality.

### 12.14.2. Sync Provider Configuration

There is very little configuration needed for this overlay, in fact for many situations merely loading the overlay will suffice.

However, because the overlay creates a contextCSN attribute in the  root entry of the database which is updated for every write operation  performed against the database and only updated in memory, it is  recommended to configure a checkpoint so that the contextCSN is written  into the underlying database to minimize recovery time after an unclean  shutdown:

```
       overlay syncprov
       syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
```

For every 100 operations or 10 minutes, which ever is sooner, the contextCSN will be checkpointed.

The four configuration directives available are **syncprov-checkpoint**, **syncprov-sessionlog**, **syncprov-nopresent** and **syncprov-reloadhint** which are covered in the man page discussing various other scenarios where this overlay can be used.

## 12.15. Translucent Proxy

### 12.15.1. Overview

This overlay can be used with a backend database such as *slapd-mdb*(5) to create a "translucent proxy".

Entries retrieved from a remote LDAP server may have some or all  attributes overridden, or new attributes added, by entries in the local  database before being presented to the client.

A search operation is first populated with entries from the remote  LDAP server, the attributes of which are then overridden with any  attributes defined in the local database. Local overrides may be  populated with the add, modify, and modrdn operations, the use of which  is restricted to the root user of the translucent local database.

A compare operation will perform a comparison with attributes defined in the local database record (if any) before any comparison is made  with data in the remote database.

### 12.15.2. Translucent Proxy Configuration

There are various options available with this overlay, but for this  example we will demonstrate adding new attributes to a remote entry and  also searching against these newly added local attributes. For more  information about overriding remote entries and search configuration,  please see *slapo-translucent(5)*



------

**Note:** The Translucent Proxy overlay will disable schema checking in the local database, so that an entry consisting of overlay  attributes need not adhere to the complete schema.

------



First we configure the overlay in the normal manner:

```
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
       include     /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema

       pidfile     ./slapd.pid
       argsfile    ./slapd.args

       database    mdb
       suffix      "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
       rootdn      "cn=trans,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
       rootpw      secret
       directory   ./openldap-data

       index       objectClass eq

       overlay     translucent
       translucent_local carLicense

       uri         ldap://192.168.X.X:389
       lastmod     off
       acl-bind    binddn="cn=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" credentials="blahblah"
```

You will notice the overlay directive and a directive to say what  attribute we want to be able to search against in the local database. We must also load the ldap backend which will connect to the remote  directory server.

Now we take an example LDAP group:

```
       # itsupport, Groups, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: sambaGroupMapping
       cn: itsupport
       gidNumber: 1000
       sambaSID: S-1-5-21-XXX
       sambaGroupType: 2
       displayName: itsupport
       memberUid: ghenry
       memberUid: joebloggs
```

and create an LDIF file we can use to add our data to the local  database, using some pretty strange choices of new attributes for  demonstration purposes:

```
       [ghenry@suretec test_configs]$ cat test-translucent-add.ldif
       dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       businessCategory: frontend-override
       carLicense: LIVID
       employeeType: special
       departmentNumber: 9999999
       roomNumber: 41L-535
```

Searching against the proxy gives:

```
       [ghenry@suretec test_configs]$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:9001 "(cn=itsupport)"
       # itsupport, Groups, OxObjects, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=itsupport,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: sambaGroupMapping
       cn: itsupport
       gidNumber: 1003
       SAMBASID: S-1-5-21-XXX
       SAMBAGROUPTYPE: 2
       displayName: itsupport
       memberUid: ghenry
       memberUid: joebloggs
       roomNumber: 41L-535
       departmentNumber: 9999999
       employeeType: special
       carLicense: LIVID
       businessCategory: frontend-override
```

Here we can see that the 5 new attributes are added to the remote entry before being returned to the our client.

Because we have configured a local attribute to search against:

```
       overlay     translucent
       translucent_local carLicense
```

we can also search for that to return the completely fabricated entry:

```
       ldapsearch -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1:9001 (carLicense=LIVID)
```

This is an extremely useful feature because you can then extend a  remote directory server locally and also search against the local  entries.



------

**Note:** Because the translucent overlay does not perform  any DN rewrites, the local and remote database instances must have the  same suffix. Other configurations will probably fail with No Such Object and other errors

## 12.16. Attribute Uniqueness

### 12.16.1. Overview

This overlay can be used with a backend database such as *slapd-mdb(5)* to enforce the uniqueness of some or all attributes within a subtree.

### 12.16.2. Attribute Uniqueness Configuration

This overlay is only effective on new data from the point the overlay is enabled. To check uniqueness for existing data, you can export and  import your data again via the LDAP Add operation, which will not be  suitable for large amounts of data, unlike **slapcat**.

For the following example, if uniqueness were enforced for the **mail** attribute, the subtree would be searched for any other records which also have a **mail** attribute containing the same value presented with an **add**, **modify** or **modrdn** operation which are unique within the configured scope. If any are found, the request is rejected.



------

**Note:** If no attributes are specified, for example **ldap:///??sub?**, then the URI applies to all non-operational attributes. However, the keyword **ignore** can be specified to exclude certain non-operational attributes.

------



To search at the base dn of the current backend database ensuring uniqueness of the **mail** attribute, we simply add the following configuration:

```
       overlay unique
       unique_uri ldap:///?mail?sub?
```

For an existing entry of:

```
       dn: cn=gavin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: inetorgperson
       cn: gavin
       sn: henry
       mail: ghenry@suretecsystems.com
```

and we then try to add a new entry of:

```
       dn: cn=robert,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: top
       objectClass: inetorgperson
       cn: robert
       sn: jones
       mail: ghenry@suretecsystems.com
```

would result in an error like so:

```
       adding new entry "cn=robert,dc=example,dc=com"
       ldap_add: Constraint violation (19)
               additional info: some attributes not unique
```

The overlay can have multiple URIs specified within a domain, allowing complex selections of objects and also have multiple **unique_uri** statements or **olcUniqueURI** attributes which will create independent domains.

For more information and details about the **strict** and **ignore** keywords, please see the *slapo-unique(5)* man page.

## 12.17. Value Sorting

### 12.17.1. Overview

The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a backend database to sort the values of specific multi-valued attributes within a subtree. The  sorting occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search  response.

### 12.17.2. Value Sorting Configuration

Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using  either numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a "weighted"  sort can be specified, which uses a numeric weight prepended to the  attribute values.

The weighted sort is always performed in ascending order, but may be  combined with the other methods for values that all have equal weights.  The weight is specified by prepending an integer weight {<weight>} in front of each value of the attribute for which weighted sorting is  desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and never returned in  search results.

Here are a few examples:

```
       loglevel    sync stats

       database    mdb
       suffix      "dc=suretecsystems,dc=com"
       directory   /usr/local/var/openldap-data

       ......

       overlay valsort
       valsort-attr memberUid ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com alpha-ascend
```

For example, ascend:

```
       # sharedemail, Groups, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: top
       cn: sharedemail
       gidNumber: 517
       memberUid: admin
       memberUid: dovecot
       memberUid: laura
       memberUid: suretec
```

For weighted, we change our data to:

```
       # sharedemail, Groups, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: top
       cn: sharedemail
       gidNumber: 517
       memberUid: {4}admin
       memberUid: {2}dovecot
       memberUid: {1}laura
       memberUid: {3}suretec
```

and change the config to:

```
       overlay valsort
       valsort-attr memberUid ou=Groups,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com weighted
```

Searching now results in:

```
       # sharedemail, Groups, OxObjects, suretecsystems.com
       dn: cn=sharedemail,ou=Groups,ou=OxObjects,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com
       objectClass: posixGroup
       objectClass: top
       cn: sharedemail
       gidNumber: 517
       memberUid: laura
       memberUid: dovecot
       memberUid: suretec
       memberUid: admin
```

## 12.18. Overlay Stacking

### 12.18.1. Overview

Overlays can be stacked, which means that more than one overlay can be instantiated for each database, or for the `frontend`. As a consequence, each overlays function is called, if defined, when  overlay execution is invoked. Multiple overlays are executed in reverse  order (as a stack) with respect to their definition in slapd.conf (5),  or with respect to their ordering in the config database, as documented  in slapd-config (5).

# 13. Schema Specification

This chapter describes how to extend the user schema used by *slapd*(8).  The chapter assumes the reader is familiar with the LDAP/X.500 information model.

The first section, [Distributed Schema Files](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html#Distributed Schema Files) details optional schema definitions provided in the distribution and where to obtain other definitions. The second section, [Extending Schema](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/schema.html#Extending Schema), details how to define new schema items.

This chapter does not discuss how to extend system schema used by *slapd*(8) as this requires source code modification.  System schema includes all  operational attribute types or any object class which allows or requires an operational attribute (directly or indirectly).

------

## 13.1. Distributed Schema Files

OpenLDAP Software is distributed with a set of schema specifications  for your use.  Each set is defined in a file suitable for inclusion  (using the `include` directive) in your *slapd.conf*(5) file.  These schema files are normally installed in the `/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema` directory.

| **File**               | **Description**                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `core.schema`          | OpenLDAP *core* (required)         |
| `cosine.schema`        | Cosine and Internet X.500 (useful) |
| `inetorgperson.schema` | InetOrgPerson (useful)             |
| `misc.schema`          | Assorted (experimental)            |
| `nis.schema`           | Network Information Services (FYI) |
| `openldap.schema`      | OpenLDAP Project (experimental)    |

To use any of these schema files, you only need to include the desired file in the global definitions portion of your *slapd.conf*(5) file.  For example:

```
        # include schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
```

Additional files may be available.  Please consult the OpenLDAP FAQ (http://www.openldap.org/faq/).



------

**Note:** You should not modify any of the schema items defined in provided files.

------



------

## 13.2. Extending Schema

Schema used by *slapd*(8) may be extended to support  additional syntaxes, matching rules, attribute types, and object  classes.  This chapter details how to add user application attribute  types and object classes using the syntaxes and matching rules already  supported by slapd.  slapd can also be extended to support additional  syntaxes, matching rules and system schema, but this requires some  programming and hence is not discussed here.

There are five steps to defining new schema:

1. obtain Object Identifier
2. choose a name prefix
3. create local schema file
4. define custom attribute types (if necessary)
5. define custom object classes

### 13.2.1. Object Identifiers

Each schema element is identified by a globally unique Object Identifier (OID).  OIDs are also used to identify other objects.  They are commonly found in protocols described by ASN.1.  In particular, they are heavily used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). As OIDs are hierarchical, your organization can obtain one OID  and branch it as needed.  For example, if your organization were  assigned OID `1.1`, you could branch the tree as follows:

| **OID**     | **Assignment**     |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| `1.1`       | Organization's OID |
| `1.1.1`     | SNMP Elements      |
| `1.1.2`     | LDAP Elements      |
| `1.1.2.1`   | AttributeTypes     |
| `1.1.2.1.1` | x-my-Attribute     |
| `1.1.2.2`   | ObjectClasses      |
| `1.1.2.2.1` | x-my-ObjectClass   |

You are, of course, free to design a hierarchy suitable to your  organizational needs under your organization's OID. No matter what  hierarchy you choose, you should maintain a registry of assignments you  make.  This can be a simple flat file or something more sophisticated  such as the *OpenLDAP OID Registry* (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=197).

For more information about Object Identifiers (and a listing service) see http://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/.

*Under no circumstances should you hijack OID namespace!*

To obtain a registered OID at *no cost*, apply for a OID under the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/) (ORG:IANA) maintained *Private Enterprise* arc. Any private enterprise (organization) may request a Private Enterprise Number (PEN) to be assigned under this arc. Just fill out the IANA form at http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page and your official PEN will be sent to you usually within a few days. Your base OID will be something like `1.3.6.1.4.1.X` where `X` is an integer.



------

**Note:** PENs obtained using this form may be used for any purpose including identifying LDAP schema elements.

------



Alternatively, OID name space may be available from a national authority (e.g., [ANSI](https://www.ansi.org/), [BSI](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/)).

### 13.2.2. Naming Elements

In addition to assigning a unique object identifier to each schema  element, you should provide at least one textual name for each element.  Names should be registered with the [IANA](https://www.iana.org/) or prefixed with "x-" to place in the "private use" name space.

The name should be both descriptive and not likely to clash with  names of other schema elements.  In particular, any name you choose  should not clash with present or future Standard Track names (this is  assured if you registered names or use names beginning with "x-").

It is noted that you can obtain your own registered name prefix so as to avoid having to register your names individually. See [RFC4520](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4520.txt) for details.

In the examples below, we have used a short prefix '`x-my-`'. Such a short prefix would only be suitable for a very large, global organization.  In general, we recommend something like '`x-de-Firm-`' (German company) or '`x-com-Example`' (elements associated with organization associated with `example.com`).

### 13.2.3. Local schema file

The `objectclass` and `attributeTypes` configuration  file directives can be used to define schema rules on entries in the  directory.  It is customary to create a file to contain definitions of  your custom schema items.  We recommend you create a file `local.schema` in `/usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema` and then include this file in your *slapd.conf*(5) file immediately after other schema `include` directives.

```
        # include schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
        # include local schema
        include /usr/local/etc/openldap/schema/local.schema
```

### 13.2.4. Attribute Type Specification

The *attributetype* directive is used to define a new attribute type.  The directive uses the same Attribute Type Description (as defined in [RFC4512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt)) used by the attributeTypes attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:

```
        attributetype <RFC4512 Attribute Type Description>
```

where Attribute Type Description is defined by the following ABNF:

```
      AttributeTypeDescription = "(" whsp
            numericoid whsp              ; AttributeType identifier
          [ "NAME" qdescrs ]             ; name used in AttributeType
          [ "DESC" qdstring ]            ; description
          [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
          [ "SUP" woid ]                 ; derived from this other
                                         ; AttributeType
          [ "EQUALITY" woid              ; Matching Rule name
          [ "ORDERING" woid              ; Matching Rule name
          [ "SUBSTR" woid ]              ; Matching Rule name
          [ "SYNTAX" whsp noidlen whsp ] ; Syntax OID
          [ "SINGLE-VALUE" whsp ]        ; default multi-valued
          [ "COLLECTIVE" whsp ]          ; default not collective
          [ "NO-USER-MODIFICATION" whsp ]; default user modifiable
          [ "USAGE" whsp AttributeUsage ]; default userApplications
          whsp ")"

      AttributeUsage =
          "userApplications"     /
          "directoryOperation"   /
          "distributedOperation" / ; DSA-shared
          "dSAOperation"          ; DSA-specific, value depends on server
```

where whsp is a space ('` `'), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. `1.1.0`), qdescrs is one or more names, woid is either the name or OID optionally followed by a length specifier (e.g `{10`}).

For example, the attribute types `name` and `cn` are defined in `core.schema` as:

```
        attributeType ( 2.5.4.41 NAME 'name'
                DESC 'name(s) associated with the object'
                EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{32768} )
        attributeType ( 2.5.4.3 NAME ( 'cn' 'commonName' )
                DESC 'common name(s) associated with the object'
                SUP name )
```

Notice that each defines the attribute's OID, provides a short name,  and a brief description.  Each name is an alias for the OID. *slapd*(8) returns the first listed name when returning results.

The first attribute, `name`, holds values of `directoryString` (UTF-8 encoded Unicode) syntax.  The syntax is specified by OID  (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 identifies the directoryString syntax).  A length recommendation of 32768 is specified.  Servers should support  values of this length, but may support longer values. The field does NOT specify a size constraint, so is ignored on servers (such as slapd)  which don't impose such size limits.  In addition, the equality and  substring matching uses case ignore rules.  Below are tables listing  commonly used syntax and matching rules (*slapd*(8) supports these and many more).

| **Name**            | **OID**                         | **Description**        |

The second attribute, `cn`, is a subtype of `name` hence it inherits the syntax, matching rules, and usage of `name`. `commonName` is an alternative name.

Neither attribute is restricted to a single value.  Both are meant  for usage by user applications.  Neither is obsolete nor collective.

The following subsections provide a couple of examples.

#### 13.2.4.1. x-my-UniqueName

Many organizations maintain a single unique name for each user. Though one could use `displayName` ([RFC2798](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2798.txt)), this attribute is really meant to be controlled by the user, not the organization.  We could just copy the definition of `displayName` from `inetorgperson.schema` and replace the OID, name, and description, e.g:

```
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'x-my-UniqueName'
                DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
                SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
                SINGLE-VALUE )
```

However, if we want this name to be used in `name` assertions, e.g. `(name=*Jane*)`, the attribute could alternatively be defined as a subtype of `name`, e.g.:

```
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.1 NAME 'x-my-UniqueName'
                DESC 'unique name with my organization'
                SUP name )
```

#### 13.2.4.2. x-my-Photo

Many organizations maintain a photo of each each user.  A `x-my-Photo` attribute type could be defined to hold a photo. Of course, one could use just use `jpegPhoto` ([RFC2798](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2798.txt)) (or a subtype) to hold the photo.  However, you can only do this if the photo is in *JPEG File Interchange Format*. Alternatively, an attribute type which uses the *Octet String* syntax can be defined, e.g.:

```
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.2 NAME 'x-my-Photo'
                DESC 'a photo (application defined format)'
                SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40
                SINGLE-VALUE )
```

In this case, the syntax doesn't specify the format of the photo.  It's assumed (maybe incorrectly) that all applications accessing this  attribute agree on the handling of values.

If you wanted to support multiple photo formats, you could define a  separate attribute type for each format, prefix the photo with some  typing information, or describe the value using ASN.1 and use the `;binary` transfer option.

Another alternative is for the attribute to hold a URI pointing to the photo.  You can model such an attribute after `labeledURI` ([RFC2079](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2079.txt)) or simply create a subtype, e.g.:

```
        attributetype ( 1.1.2.1.3 NAME 'x-my-PhotoURI'
                DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                SUP labeledURI )
```

### 13.2.5. Object Class Specification

The *objectclasses* directive is used to define a new object class.  The directive uses the same Object Class Description (as defined in [RFC4512](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt)) used by the objectClasses attribute found in the subschema subentry, e.g.:

```
        objectclass <RFC4512 Object Class Description>
```

where Object Class Description is defined by the following ABNF:

```
        ObjectClassDescription = "(" whsp
                numericoid whsp      ; ObjectClass identifier
                [ "NAME" qdescrs ]
                [ "DESC" qdstring ]
                [ "OBSOLETE" whsp ]
                [ "SUP" oids ]       ; Superior ObjectClasses
                [ ( "ABSTRACT" / "STRUCTURAL" / "AUXILIARY" ) whsp ]
                        ; default structural
                [ "MUST" oids ]      ; AttributeTypes
                [ "MAY" oids ]       ; AttributeTypes
                whsp ")"
```

where whsp is a space ('` `'), numericoid is a globally unique OID in dotted-decimal form (e.g. `1.1.0`), qdescrs is one or more names, and oids is one or more names and/or OIDs.

#### 13.2.5.1. x-my-PhotoObject

To define an *auxiliary* object class which allows x-my-Photo to be added to any existing entry.

```
        objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.1 NAME 'x-my-PhotoObject'
                DESC 'mixin x-my-Photo'
                AUXILIARY
                MAY x-my-Photo )
```

#### 13.2.5.2. x-my-Person

If your organization would like have a private *structural* object class to instantiate users, you can subclass one of the existing person classes, such as `inetOrgPerson` ([RFC2798](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2798.txt)), and add any additional attributes which you desire.

```
        objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.2 NAME 'x-my-Person'
                DESC 'my person'
                SUP inetOrgPerson
                MUST ( x-my-UniqueName $ givenName )
                MAY x-my-Photo )
```

The object class inherits the required/allowed attribute types of `inetOrgPerson` but requires `x-my-UniqueName` and `givenName` and allows `x-my-Photo`.

### 13.2.6. OID Macros

To ease the management and use of OIDs, *slapd*(8) supports *Object Identifier* macros.  The `objectIdentifier` directive is used to equate a macro (name) with a OID.  The OID may  possibly be derived from a previously defined OID macro.   The *slapd.conf*(5) syntax is:

```
        objectIdentifier <name> { <oid> | <name>[:<suffix>] }
```

The following demonstrates definition of a set of OID macros and their use in defining schema elements:

```
        objectIdentifier myOID  1.1
        objectIdentifier mySNMP myOID:1
        objectIdentifier myLDAP myOID:2
        objectIdentifier myAttributeType        myLDAP:1
        objectIdentifier myObjectClass  myLDAP:2
        attributetype ( myAttributeType:3 NAME 'x-my-PhotoURI'
                DESC 'URI and optional label referring to a photo'
                SUP labeledURI )
        objectclass ( myObjectClass:1 NAME 'x-my-PhotoObject'
                DESC 'mixin x-my-Photo'
                AUXILIARY
                MAY x-my-Photo )
```

# 14. Security Considerations

OpenLDAP Software is designed to run in a wide variety of computing  environments from tightly-controlled closed networks to the global  Internet.  Hence, OpenLDAP Software supports many different security  mechanisms.  This chapter describes these mechanisms and discusses  security considerations for using OpenLDAP Software.

------

## 14.1. Network Security

### 14.1.1. Selective Listening

By default, *slapd*(8) will listen on both the IPv4 and IPv6 "any" addresses.  It is often desirable to have *slapd* listen on select address/port pairs.  For example, listening only on the IPv4 address `127.0.0.1` will disallow remote access to the directory server. E.g.:

```
        slapd -h ldap://127.0.0.1
```

While the server can be configured to listen on a particular  interface address, this doesn't necessarily restrict access to the  server to only those networks accessible via that interface.   To  selective restrict remote access, it is recommend that an [IP Firewall](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/security.html#IP Firewall) be used to restrict access.

See Command-line Options and *slapd*(8) for more information.

### 14.1.2. IP Firewall

IP firewall capabilities of the server system can be  used to restrict access based upon the client's IP address and/or  network interface used to communicate with the client.

Generally, *slapd*(8) listens on port 389/tcp for [ldap://](ldap://) sessions and port 636/tcp for [ldaps://](ldaps://)) sessions.  *slapd*(8) may be configured to listen on other ports.

As specifics of how to configure IP firewall are dependent on the  particular kind of IP firewall used, no examples are provided here. See  the document associated with your IP firewall.

### 14.1.3. TCP Wrappers

*slapd*(8) supports TCP Wrappers.  TCP Wrappers  provide a rule-based access control system for controlling TCP/IP access to the server.  For example, the *host_options*(5) rule:

```
        slapd: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 : ALLOW
        slapd: ALL : DENY
```

allows only incoming connections from the private network `10.0.0.0` and localhost (`127.0.0.1`) to access the directory service.



------

**Note:** IP addresses are used as *slapd*(8) is not normally configured to perform reverse lookups.

------



It is noted that TCP wrappers require the connection to be accepted.  As significant processing is required just to deny a connection, it is  generally advised that IP firewall protection be used instead of TCP  wrappers.

See *hosts_access*(5) for more information on TCP wrapper rules.

------

## 14.2. Data Integrity and Confidentiality Protection

Transport Layer Security (TLS) can be used to provide data integrity and confidentiality protection.  OpenLDAP supports negotiation of TLS (SSL) via both StartTLS and [ldaps://](ldaps://). See the [Using TLS](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/tls.html) chapter for more information.  StartTLS is the standard track mechanism.

A number of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms, such as DIGEST-MD5 and GSSAPI, also provide data integrity and confidentiality protection.  See the [Using SASL](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html) chapter for more information.

### 14.2.1. Security Strength Factors

The server uses Security Strength Factors (SSF) to  indicate the relative strength of protection.  A SSF of zero (0)  indicates no protections are in place.  A SSF of one (1) indicates  integrity protection are in place.  A SSF greater than one (>1)  roughly correlates to the effective encryption key length.  For example, DES is 56, 3DES is 112, and AES 128, 192, or 256.

A number of administrative controls rely on SSFs associated with TLS and SASL protection in place on an LDAP session.

`security` controls disallow operations when appropriate protections are not in place.  For example:

```
        security ssf=1 update_ssf=112
```

requires integrity protection for all operations and encryption  protection, 3DES equivalent, for update operations (e.g. add, delete,  modify, etc.).  See *slapd.conf*(5) for details.

For fine-grained control, SSFs may be used in access controls. See the [Access Control](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/access-control.html) section for more information.

------

## 14.3. Authentication Methods

### 14.3.1. "simple" method

The LDAP "simple" method has three modes of operation:

- anonymous,
- unauthenticated, and
- user/password authenticated.

Anonymous access is requested by providing no name and no password to the "simple" bind operation.  Unauthenticated access is requested by  providing a name but no password.  Authenticated access is requested by  providing a valid name and password.

An anonymous bind results in an *anonymous* authorization association.  Anonymous bind mechanism is enabled by default, but can be disabled by specifying "`disallow bind_anon`" in *slapd.conf*(5).



------

**Note:** Disabling the anonymous bind mechanism does not  prevent anonymous access to the directory. To require authentication to  access the directory, one should instead specify "`require authc`".

------



An unauthenticated bind also results in an *anonymous* authorization association.  Unauthenticated bind mechanism is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying "`allow bind_anon_cred`" in *slapd.conf*(5).  As a number of LDAP applications mistakenly generate unauthenticated  bind request when authenticated access was intended (that is, they do  not ensure a password was provided), this mechanism should generally  remain disabled.

A successful user/password authenticated bind results in a user  authorization identity, the provided name, being associated with the  session.  User/password authenticated bind is enabled by default.  However, as this mechanism itself offers no eavesdropping protection  (e.g., the password is set in the clear), it is recommended that it be  used only in tightly controlled systems or when the LDAP session is  protected by other means (e.g., TLS, IPsec). Where the  administrator relies on TLS to protect the password, it is recommended  that unprotected authentication be disabled.  This is done using the `security` directive's `simple_bind` option, which provides fine grain control over the level of confidential protection to require for *simple* user/password authentication. E.g., using `security simple_bind=56` would require *simple* binds to use encryption of DES equivalent or better.

The user/password authenticated bind mechanism can be completely disabled by setting "`disallow bind_simple`".



------

**Note:** An unsuccessful bind always results in the session having an *anonymous* authorization association.

------



### 14.3.2. SASL method

The LDAP SASL method allows the use of any SASL authentication mechanism. The [Using SASL](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html) section discusses the use of SASL.

------

## 14.4. Password Storage

LDAP passwords are normally stored in the *userPassword* attribute. [RFC4519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4519.txt) specifies that passwords are not stored in encrypted (or hashed) form.  This allows a wide range of password-based authentication mechanisms,  such as `DIGEST-MD5` to be used. This is also the most interoperable storage scheme.

However, it may be desirable to store a hash of password instead. *slapd*(8) supports a variety of storage schemes for the administrator to choose from.



------

**Note:** Values of password attributes, regardless of  storage scheme used, should be protected as if they were clear text.   Hashed passwords are subject to *dictionary attacks* and *brute-force attacks*.

------



The *userPassword* attribute is allowed to have more than one  value, and it is possible for each value to be stored in a different  form. During authentication, *slapd* will iterate through the  values until it finds one that matches the offered password or until it  runs out of values to inspect.  The storage scheme is stored as a prefix on the value, so a hashed password using the Salted SHA1 (`SSHA`) scheme looks like:

```
 userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3
```

The advantage of hashed passwords is that an attacker which discovers the hash does not have direct access to the actual password.  Unfortunately, as dictionary and brute force attacks are generally quite easy for attackers to successfully mount, this advantage is marginal at best (this is why all modern Unix systems use shadow password files).

The disadvantages of hashed storage is that they are non-standard,  may cause interoperability problem, and generally preclude the use of  stronger than Simple (or SASL/PLAIN) password-based authentication  mechanisms such as `DIGEST-MD5`.

### 14.4.1. SSHA password storage scheme

This is the salted version of the SHA scheme. It is believed to be the most secure password storage scheme supported by *slapd*.

These values represent the same password:

```
 userPassword: {SSHA}DkMTwBl+a/3DQTxCYEApdUtNXGgdUac3
 userPassword: {SSHA}d0Q0626PSH9VUld7yWpR0k6BlpQmtczb
```

### 14.4.2. CRYPT password storage scheme

This scheme uses the operating system's *crypt(3)* hash function. It normally produces the traditional Unix-style 13 character hash, but on systems with `glibc2` it can also generate the more secure 34-byte MD5 hash.

```
 userPassword: {CRYPT}aUihad99hmev6
 userPassword: {CRYPT}$1$czBJdDqS$TmkzUAb836oMxg/BmIwN.1
```

The advantage of the CRYPT scheme is that passwords can be  transferred to or from an existing Unix password file without having to  know the cleartext form. Both forms of *crypt* include salt so they have some resistance to dictionary attacks.



------

**Note:** Since this scheme uses the operating system's *crypt(3)* hash function, it is therefore operating system specific.

------



### 14.4.3. MD5 password storage scheme

This scheme simply takes the MD5 hash of the password and stores it in base64 encoded form:

```
 userPassword: {MD5}Xr4ilOzQ4PCOq3aQ0qbuaQ==
```

Although safer than cleartext storage, this is not a very secure  scheme. The MD5 algorithm is fast, and because there is no salt the  scheme is vulnerable to a dictionary attack.

### 14.4.4. SMD5 password storage scheme

This improves on the basic MD5 scheme by adding salt (random data  which means that there are many possible representations of a given  plaintext password). For example, both of these values represent the  same password:

```
 userPassword: {SMD5}4QWGWZpj9GCmfuqEvm8HtZhZS6E=
 userPassword: {SMD5}g2/J/7D5EO6+oPdklp5p8YtNFk4=
```

### 14.4.5. SHA password storage scheme

Like the MD5 scheme, this simply feeds the password through an SHA  hash process. SHA is thought to be more secure than MD5, but the lack of salt leaves the scheme exposed to dictionary attacks.

```
 userPassword: {SHA}5en6G6MezRroT3XKqkdPOmY/BfQ=
```

### 14.4.6. SASL password storage scheme

This is not really a password storage scheme at all. It uses the value of the *userPassword* attribute to delegate password verification to another process. See below for more information.



------

**Note:** This is not the same as using SASL to authenticate the LDAP session.

------



------

## 14.5. Pass-Through authentication

Since OpenLDAP 2.0 *slapd* has had the ability to delegate password verification to a separate process. This uses the *sasl_checkpass(3)* function so it can use any back-end server that Cyrus SASL supports for checking passwords. The choice is very wide, as one option is to use *saslauthd(8)* which in turn can use local files, Kerberos, an IMAP server, another LDAP server, or anything supported by the PAM mechanism.

The server must be built with the `--enable-spasswd` configuration option to enable pass-through authentication.



------

**Note:** This is not the same as using a SASL mechanism to authenticate the LDAP session.

------



Pass-Through authentication works only with plaintext passwords, as  used in the "simple bind" and "SASL PLAIN" authentication mechanisms.

Pass-Through authentication is selective: it only affects users whose *userPassword* attribute has a value marked with the "{SASL}" scheme. The format of the attribute is:

```
 userPassword: {SASL}username@realm
```

The *username* and *realm* are passed to the SASL  authentication mechanism and are used to identify the account whose  password is to be verified. This allows arbitrary mapping between  entries in OpenLDAP and accounts known to the backend authentication  service.

It would be wise to use access control to prevent users from changing their passwords through LDAP where they have pass-through  authentication enabled.

### 14.5.1. Configuring slapd to use an authentication provider

Where an entry has a "{SASL}" password value, OpenLDAP delegates the  whole process of validating that entry's password to Cyrus SASL. All the configuration is therefore done in SASL config files.

The first file to be considered is confusingly named *slapd.conf* and is typically found in the SASL library directory, often `/usr/lib/sasl2/slapd.conf` This file governs the use of SASL when talking LDAP to *slapd* as well as the use of SASL backends for pass-through authentication. See `options.html` in the [Cyrus SASL](https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/) docs for full details. Here is a simple example for a server that will use *saslauthd* to verify passwords:

```
 mech_list: plain
 pwcheck_method: saslauthd
 saslauthd_path: /var/run/sasl2/mux
```

### 14.5.2. Configuring saslauthd

*saslauthd* is capable of using many different authentication services: see *saslauthd(8)* for details. A common requirement is to delegate some or all authentication to another LDAP server. Here is a sample `saslauthd.conf` that uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD):

```
 ldap_servers: ldap://dc1.example.com/ ldap://dc2.example.com/

 ldap_search_base: cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
 ldap_filter: (userPrincipalName=%u)

 ldap_bind_dn: cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com
 ldap_password: secret
```

In this case, *saslauthd* is run with the `ldap` authentication mechanism and is set to combine the SASL realm with the login name:

```
 saslauthd -a ldap -r
```

This means that the "username@realm" string from the *userPassword* attribute ends up being used to search AD for  "userPrincipalName=username@realm" - the password is then verified by  attempting to bind to AD using the entry found by the search and the  password supplied by the LDAP client.

### 14.5.3. Testing pass-through authentication

It is usually best to start with the back-end authentication provider and work through *saslauthd* and *slapd* towards the LDAP client.

In the AD example above, first check that the DN and password that *saslauthd* will use when it connects to AD are valid:

```
 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w secret \
      -b '' \
      -s base
```

Next check that a sample AD user can be found:

```
 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=saslauthd,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w secret \
      -b cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      "(userPrincipalName=user@ad.example.com)"
```

Check that the user can bind to AD:

```
 ldapsearch -x -H ldap://dc1.example.com/ \
      -D cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -w userpassword \
      -b cn=user,cn=Users,DC=ad,DC=example,DC=com \
      -s base \
        "(objectclass=*)"
```

If all that works then *saslauthd* should be able to do the same:

```
 testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p userpassword
 testsaslauthd -u user@ad.example.com -p wrongpassword
```

Now put the magic token into an entry in OpenLDAP:

```
 userPassword: {SASL}user@ad.example.com
```

It should now be possible to bind to OpenLDAP using the DN of that entry and the password of the AD user.

# 15. Using SASL

OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of authenticating via the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework, which is detailed in [RFC4422](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4422.txt).   This chapter describes how to make use of SASL in OpenLDAP.

There are several industry standard authentication mechanisms that can be used with SASL, including GSSAPI for Kerberos V, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN and EXTERNAL for use with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

The standard client tools provided with OpenLDAP Software, such as *ldapsearch*(1) and *ldapmodify*(1), will by default attempt to authenticate the user to the LDAP directory server using SASL.  Basic authentication service can be set  up by the LDAP administrator with a few steps, allowing users to be  authenticated to the slapd server as their LDAP entry.  With a few extra steps, some users and services can be allowed to exploit SASL's proxy  authorization feature, allowing them to authenticate themselves and then switch their identity to that of another user or service.

This chapter assumes you have read *Cyrus SASL for System Administrators*, provided with the [Cyrus SASL](https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/) package (in `doc/sysadmin.html`) and have a working Cyrus SASL installation.  You should use the Cyrus SASL `sample_client` and `sample_server` to test your SASL installation before attempting to make use of it with OpenLDAP Software.

Note that in the following text the term *user* is used to describe a person or application entity who is connecting to the LDAP server via an LDAP client, such as *ldapsearch*(1).  That is, the term *user* not only applies to both an individual using an LDAP client, but to an  application entity which issues LDAP client operations without direct  user control.  For example, an e-mail server which uses LDAP operations  to access information held in an LDAP server is an application entity.

------

## 15.1. SASL Security Considerations

SASL offers many different authentication mechanisms.  This section briefly outlines security considerations.

Some mechanisms, such as PLAIN and LOGIN, offer no greater security over LDAP *simple* authentication.  Like LDAP *simple* authentication, such mechanisms should not be used unless you have  adequate security protections in place.  It is recommended that these  mechanisms be used only in conjunction with Transport Layer Security (TLS).  Use of PLAIN and LOGIN are not discussed further in this document.

The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism is the mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism for LDAPv3.  Though DIGEST-MD5 is not a strong authentication mechanism in comparison with trusted third party authentication systems (such as Kerberos or public key systems), it does offer significant protections against a number of attacks.  Unlike the CRAM-MD5 mechanism, it prevents chosen plaintext attacks.  DIGEST-MD5 is favored over the use of plaintext password mechanisms.  The CRAM-MD5 mechanism  is deprecated in favor of DIGEST-MD5.  Use of [DIGEST-MD5](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#DIGEST-MD5) is discussed below.

The GSSAPI mechanism utilizes GSS-API Kerberos V to provide secure authentication services.  The KERBEROS_V4 mechanism is available for those using Kerberos IV.  Kerberos is viewed as a  secure, distributed authentication system suitable for both small and  large enterprises.  Use of [GSSAPI](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#GSSAPI) and [KERBEROS_V4](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#KERBEROS_V4) are discussed below.

The EXTERNAL mechanism utilizes authentication services provided by lower level network services such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).  When used in conjunction with TLS X.509-based public key technology, EXTERNAL offers strong authentication. TLS is discussed in the [Using TLS](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/tls.html) chapter.

EXTERNAL can also be used with the `ldapi:///` transport, as Unix-domain sockets can report the UID and GID of the client process.

There are other strong authentication mechanisms to choose from, including OTP (one time passwords) and SRP (secure remote passwords).  These mechanisms are not discussed in this document.

## 15.2. SASL Authentication

Getting basic SASL authentication running involves a few steps. The  first step configures your slapd server environment so that it can  communicate with client programs using the security system in place at  your site. This usually involves setting up a service key, a public key, or other form of secret. The second step concerns mapping  authentication identities to LDAP DN's, which depends on  how entries are laid out in your directory. An explanation of the first  step will be given in the next section using Kerberos V4 as an example  mechanism. The steps necessary for your site's authentication mechanism  will be similar, but a guide to every mechanism available under SASL is  beyond the scope of this chapter. The second step is described in the  section [Mapping Authentication Identities](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#Mapping Authentication Identities).

### 15.2.1. GSSAPI

This section describes the use of the SASL GSSAPI mechanism and  Kerberos V with OpenLDAP.  It will be assumed that you have Kerberos V  deployed, you are familiar with the operation of the system, and that  your users are trained in its use.  This section also assumes you have  familiarized yourself with the use of the GSSAPI mechanism by reading *Configuring GSSAPI and Cyrus SASL* (provided with Cyrus SASL in the `doc/gssapi` file) and successfully experimented with the Cyrus provided `sample_server` and `sample_client` applications.  General information about Kerberos is available at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/.

To use the GSSAPI mechanism with *slapd*(8) one must create a service key with a principal for *ldap* service within the realm for the host on which the service runs.  For example, if you run *slapd* on `directory.example.com` and your realm is `EXAMPLE.COM`, you need to create a service key with the principal:

```
        ldap/directory.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
```

When *slapd*(8) runs, it must have access to this key.  This is generally done by placing the key into a keytab file, `/etc/krb5.keytab`.  See your Kerberos and Cyrus SASL documentation for information regarding keytab location settings.

To use the GSSAPI mechanism to authenticate to the directory, the  user obtains a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) prior to running the LDAP  client.  When using OpenLDAP client tools, the user may mandate use of  the GSSAPI mechanism by specifying `-Y GSSAPI` as a command option.

For the purposes of authentication and authorization, *slapd*(8) associates an authentication request DN of the form:

```
        uid=<primary[/instance][@realm]>,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
```

The realm is omitted by Cyrus SASL if it's equal to the default realm of the server in `/etc/krb5.conf`.

Continuing our example, a user with the Kerberos principal `kurt@EXAMPLE.COM` would have the associated DN:

```
        uid=kurt,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
```

and the principal `ursula/admin@FOREIGN.REALM` would have the associated DN:

```
        uid=ursula/admin@foreign.realm,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
```

The authentication request DN can be used directly in ACLs and `groupOfNames` "member" attributes, since it is of legitimate LDAP DN format.  Or  alternatively, the authentication DN could be mapped before use.  See  the section [Mapping Authentication Identities](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#Mapping Authentication Identities) for details.

If you configure the *olcSaslRealm* then it will be inserted  as an extra component in the authorization DN, regardless of any  Kerberos realms in use. For example, if you set olcSaslRealm to `example.com` then you will get:

```
        uid=kurt,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
        uid=ursula/admin@foreign.realm,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
```

### 15.2.2. KERBEROS_V4

This section describes the use of the SASL KERBEROS_V4 mechanism with OpenLDAP.  It will be assumed that you are familiar with the workings  of the Kerberos IV security system, and that your site has Kerberos IV  deployed.  Your users should be familiar with authentication policy, how to receive credentials in a Kerberos ticket cache, and how to refresh  expired credentials.



------

**Note:** KERBEROS_V4 and Kerberos IV are deprecated in favor of GSSAPI and Kerberos V.

------



Client programs will need to be able to obtain a session key for use  when connecting to your LDAP server. This allows the LDAP server to know the identity of the user, and allows the client to know it is  connecting to a legitimate server. If encryption layers are to be used,  the session key can also be used to help negotiate that option.

The slapd server runs the service called "*ldap*", and the  server will require a srvtab file with a service key.  SASL aware client programs will be obtaining an "ldap" service ticket with the user's  ticket granting ticket (TGT), with the instance of the ticket matching  the hostname of the OpenLDAP server. For example, if your realm is named `EXAMPLE.COM` and the slapd server is running on the host named `directory.example.com`, the `/etc/srvtab` file on the server will have a service key

```
        ldap.directory@EXAMPLE.COM
```

When an LDAP client is authenticating a user to the directory using  the KERBEROS_IV mechanism, it will request a session key for that same  principal, either from the ticket cache or by obtaining a new one from  the Kerberos server.  This will require the TGT to be available and  valid in the cache as well.  If it is not present or has expired, the  client may print out the message:

```
        ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error
```

When the service ticket is obtained, it will be passed to the LDAP  server as proof of the user's identity.  The server will extract the  identity and realm out of the service ticket using SASL library calls,  and convert them into an *authentication request DN* of the form

```
        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth
```

So in our above example, if the user's name were "adamson", the authentication request DN would be:

```
        uid=adamson,cn=example.com,cn=kerberos_v4,cn=auth
```

This authentication request DN can be used directly ACLs or, alternatively, mapped prior to use.  See the section [Mapping Authentication Identities](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#Mapping Authentication Identities) for details.

### 15.2.3. DIGEST-MD5

This section describes the use of the SASL DIGEST-MD5 mechanism using secrets stored either in the directory itself or in Cyrus SASL's own  database. DIGEST-MD5 relies on the client and the server sharing a  "secret", usually a password. The server generates a challenge and the  client a response proving that it knows the shared secret. This is much  more secure than simply sending the secret over the wire.

Cyrus SASL supports several shared-secret mechanisms. To do this, it  needs access to the plaintext password (unlike mechanisms which pass  plaintext passwords over the wire, where the server can store a hashed  version of the password).

The server's copy of the shared-secret may be stored in Cyrus SASL's own *sasldb* database, in an external system accessed via *saslauthd*, or in LDAP database itself.  In either case it is very important to  apply file access controls and LDAP access controls to prevent exposure  of the passwords.  The configuration and commands discussed in this  section assume the use of Cyrus SASL 2.1.

To use secrets stored in *sasldb*, simply add users with the *saslpasswd2* command:

```
       saslpasswd2 -c <username>
```

The passwords for such users must be managed with the *saslpasswd2* command.

To use secrets stored in the LDAP directory, place plaintext passwords in the `userPassword` attribute.  It will be necessary to add an option to `slapd.conf` to make sure that passwords set using the LDAP Password Modify Operation are stored in plaintext:

```
       password-hash   {CLEARTEXT}
```

Passwords stored in this way can be managed either with *ldappasswd*(1) or by simply modifying the `userPassword` attribute.  Regardless of where the passwords are stored, a mapping will be needed from authentication request DN to user's DN.

The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism produces authentication IDs of the form:

```
        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
```

If the default realm is used, the realm name is omitted from the ID, giving:

```
        uid=<username>,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
```

See [Mapping Authentication Identities](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#Mapping Authentication Identities) below for information on optional mapping of identities.

With suitable mappings in place, users can specify SASL IDs when performing LDAP operations, and the password stored in *sasldb* or in the directory itself will be used to verify the authentication. For example, the user identified by the directory entry:

```
       dn: cn=Andrew Findlay+uid=u000997,dc=example,dc=com
       objectclass: inetOrgPerson
       objectclass: person
       sn: Findlay
       uid: u000997
       userPassword: secret
```

can issue commands of the form:

```
       ldapsearch -Y DIGEST-MD5 -U u000997 ...
```



------

**Note:** in each of the above cases, no authorization identity (e.g. `-X`) was provided.   Unless you are attempting [SASL Proxy Authorization](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#SASL Proxy Authorization), no authorization identity should be specified. The server will infer an authorization identity from authentication identity (as described  below).

------



### 15.2.4. EXTERNAL

The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism makes use of an authentication performed by a lower-level protocol: usually TLS or Unix IPC

Each transport protocol returns Authentication Identities in its own format:

#### 15.2.4.1. TLS Authentication Identity Format

This is the Subject DN from the client-side certificate. Note that  DNs are displayed differently by LDAP and by X.509, so a certificate  issued to

```
        C=gb, O=The Example Organisation, CN=A Person
```

will produce an authentication identity of:

```
        cn=A Person,o=The Example Organisation,c=gb
```

Note that you must set a suitable value for TLSVerifyClient to make  the server request the use of a client-side certificate. Without this,  the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will not be offered. Refer to the [Using TLS](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/tls.html) chapter for details.

#### 15.2.4.2. IPC (ldapi:///) Identity Format

This is formed from the Unix UID and GID of the client process:

```
        gidNumber=<number>+uidNumber=<number>,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
```

Thus, a client process running as `root` will be:

```
        gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth
```

### 15.2.5. Mapping Authentication Identities

The authentication mechanism in the slapd server will use SASL  library calls to obtain the authenticated user's "username", based on  whatever underlying authentication mechanism was used.  This username is in the namespace of the authentication mechanism, and not in the normal LDAP namespace. As stated in the sections above, that username is  reformatted into an authentication request DN of the form

```
        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth
```

or

```
        uid=<username>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth
```

depending on whether or not <mechanism> employs the concept of  "realms".  Note also that the realm part will be omitted if the default  realm was used in the authentication.

The *ldapwhoami*(1) command may be used to determine the  identity associated with the user.  It is very useful for determining  proper function of mappings.

It is not intended that you should add LDAP entries of the above form to your LDAP database.  Chances are you have an LDAP entry for each of  the persons that will be authenticating to LDAP, laid out in your  directory tree, and the tree does not start at cn=auth. But if your site has a clear mapping between the "username" and an LDAP entry for the  person, you will be able to configure your LDAP server to automatically  map a authentication request DN to the user's *authentication DN*.



------

**Note:** it is not required that the authentication  request DN nor the user's authentication DN resulting from the mapping  refer to an entry held in the directory.  However, additional  capabilities become available (see below).

------



The LDAP administrator will need to tell the slapd server how to map  an authentication request DN to a user's authentication DN. This is done by adding one or more `authz-regexp` directives to the *slapd.conf*(5) file.  This directive takes two arguments:

```
        authz-regexp   <search pattern>   <replacement pattern>
```

The authentication request DN is compared to the search pattern using the regular expression functions *regcomp*() and *regexec*(), and if it matches, it is rewritten as the replacement pattern. If there are multiple `authz-regexp` directives, only the first whose search pattern matches the  authentication identity is used. The string that is output from the  replacement pattern should be the authentication DN of the user or an  LDAP URL.  If replacement string produces a DN, the entry named by this  DN need not be held by this server.  If the replace string produces an  LDAP URL, that LDAP URL must evaluate to one and only one entry held by  this server.

The search pattern can contain any of the regular expression characters listed in *regexec*(3C). The main characters of note are dot ".", asterisk "*", and the open and close parenthesis "(" and ")".  Essentially, the dot matches any  character, the asterisk allows zero or more repeats of the immediately  preceding character or pattern, and terms in parenthesis are remembered  for the replacement pattern.

The replacement pattern will produce either a DN or URL referring to  the user.  Anything from the authentication request DN that matched a  string in parenthesis in the search pattern is stored in the variable  "$1". That variable "$1" can appear in the replacement pattern, and will be replaced by the string from the authentication request DN. If there  were multiple sets of parentheses in the search pattern, the variables  $2, $3, etc are used.

### 15.2.6. Direct Mapping

Where possible, direct mapping of the authentication request DN to  the user's DN is generally recommended.  Aside from avoiding the expense of searching for the user's DN, it allows mapping to DNs which refer to entries not held by this server.

Suppose the authentication request DN is written as:

```
        uid=adamson,cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
```

and the user's actual LDAP entry is:

```
        uid=adamson,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
```

then the following `authz-regexp` directive in *slapd.conf*(5) would provide for direct mapping.

```
        authz-regexp
          uid=([^,]*),cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
          uid=$1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
```

An even more lenient rule could be written as

```
        authz-regexp
          uid=([^,]*),cn=[^,]*,cn=auth
          uid=$1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
```

Be careful about setting the search pattern too leniently, however,  since it may mistakenly allow persons to become authenticated as a DN to which they should not have access.  It is better to write several  strict directives than one lenient directive which has security holes.   If there is only one authentication mechanism in place at your site, and zero or one realms in use, you might be able to map between  authentication identities and LDAP DN's with a single `authz-regexp` directive.

Don't forget to allow for the case where the realm is omitted as well as the case with an explicitly specified realm. This may well require a separate `authz-regexp` directive for each case, with the explicit-realm entry being listed first.

### 15.2.7. Search-based mappings

There are a number of cases where mapping to a LDAP URL may be  appropriate.  For instance, some sites may have person objects located  in multiple areas of the LDAP tree, such as if there were an `ou=accounting` tree and an `ou=engineering` tree, with persons interspersed between them.  Or, maybe the desired  mapping must be based upon information in the user's information.  Consider the need to map the above authentication request DN to user  whose entry is as follows:

```
        dn: cn=Mark Adamson,ou=People,dc=Example,dc=COM
        objectclass: person
        cn: Mark Adamson
        uid: adamson
```

The information in the authentication request DN is insufficient to  allow the user's DN to be directly derived, instead the user's DN must  be searched for.  For these situations, a replacement pattern which  produces a LDAP URL can be used in the `authz-regexp` directives.  This URL will then be used to perform an internal search of the LDAP  database to find the person's authentication DN.

An LDAP URL, similar to other URL's, is of the form

```
        ldap://<host>/<base>?<attrs>?<scope>?<filter>
```

This contains all of the elements necessary to perform an LDAP  search:  the name of the server <host>, the LDAP DN search base  <base>, the LDAP attributes to retrieve <attrs>, the search  scope <scope> which is one of the three options "base", "one", or  "sub", and lastly an LDAP search filter <filter>.  Since the  search is for an LDAP DN within the current server, the <host>  portion should be empty.  The <attrs> field is also ignored since  only the DN is of concern.  These two elements are left in the format of the URL to maintain the clarity of what information goes where in the  string.

Suppose that the person in the example from above did in fact have an authentication username of "adamson" and that information was kept in  the attribute "uid" in their LDAP entry. The `authz-regexp` directive might be written as

```
        authz-regexp
          uid=([^,]*),cn=example.com,cn=gssapi,cn=auth
          ldap:///ou=people,dc=example,dc=com??one?(uid=$1)
```

This will initiate an internal search of the LDAP database inside the slapd server. If the search returns exactly one entry, it is accepted  as being the DN of the user. If there are more than one entries  returned, or if there are zero entries returned, the authentication  fails and the user's connection is left bound as the authentication  request DN.

The attributes that are used in the search filter <filter> in  the URL should be indexed to allow faster searching. If they are not,  the authentication step alone can take uncomfortably long periods, and  users may assume the server is down.

A more complex site might have several realms in use, each mapping to a different subtree in the directory.  These can be handled with  statements of the form:

```
        # Match Engineering realm
        authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=engineering.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=eng,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))

        # Match Accounting realm
        authz-regexp
           uid=([^,].*),cn=accounting.example.com,cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=accounting,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))

        # Default realm is customers.example.com
        authz-regexp
           uid=([^,]*),cn=digest-md5,cn=auth
           ldap:///dc=customers,dc=example,dc=com??one?(&(uid=$1)(objectClass=person))
```

Note that the explicitly-named realms are handled first, to avoid the realm name becoming part of the UID.  Also note the use of scope and  filters to limit matching to desirable entries.

Note as well that `authz-regexp` internal search are subject to access controls.  Specifically, the authentication identity must have `auth` access.

See *slapd.conf*(5) for more detailed information.

------

## 15.3. SASL Proxy Authorization

The SASL offers a feature known as *proxy authorization*,  which allows an authenticated user to request that they act on the  behalf of another user.  This step occurs after the user has obtained an authentication DN, and involves sending an authorization identity to  the server. The server will then make a decision on whether or not to  allow the authorization to occur. If it is allowed, the user's LDAP  connection is switched to have a binding DN derived from the  authorization identity, and the LDAP session proceeds with the access of the new authorization DN.

The decision to allow an authorization to proceed depends on the  rules and policies of the site where LDAP is running, and thus cannot be made by SASL alone. The SASL library leaves it up to the server to make the decision. The LDAP administrator sets the guidelines of who can  authorize to what identity by adding information into the LDAP database  entries. By default, the authorization features are disabled, and must  be explicitly configured by the LDAP administrator before use.

The rules governing proxy authorization are not just used for SASL:  they also control the use of the LDAP Proxied Authorization Control (RFC 4370).

### 15.3.1. Uses of Proxy Authorization

This sort of service is useful when one entity needs to act on the  behalf of many other users. For example, users may be directed to a web  page to make changes to their personal information in their LDAP entry.  The users authenticate to the web server to establish their identity,  but the web server CGI cannot authenticate to the LDAP server as that  user to make changes for them. Instead, the web server authenticates  itself to the LDAP server as a service identity, say,

```
        cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com
```

and then it will SASL authorize to the DN of the user. Once so  authorized, the CGI makes changes to the LDAP entry of the user, and as  far as the slapd server can tell for its ACLs, it is the user themself  on the other end of the connection. The user could have connected to the LDAP server directly and authenticated as themself, but that would  require the user to have more knowledge of LDAP clients, knowledge which the web page provides in an easier format.

Proxy authorization can also be used to limit access to an account  that has greater access to the database. Such an account, perhaps even  the root DN specified in *slapd.conf*(5), can have a strict list  of people who can authorize to that DN. Changes to the LDAP database  could then be only allowed by that DN, and in order to become that DN,  users must first authenticate as one of the persons on the list. This  allows for better auditing of who made changes to the LDAP database.  If people were allowed to authenticate directly to the privileged account, possibly through the `rootpw` *slapd.conf*(5) directive or through a `userPassword` attribute, then auditing becomes more difficult.

Note that after a successful proxy authorization, the original  authentication DN of the LDAP connection is overwritten by the new DN  from the authorization request. If a service program is able to  authenticate itself as its own authentication DN and then authorize to  other DN's, and it is planning on switching to several different  identities during one LDAP session, it will need to authenticate itself  each time before authorizing to another DN (or use a different proxy  authorization mechanism).  The slapd server does not keep record of the  service program's ability to switch to other DN's. On authentication  mechanisms like Kerberos this will not require multiple connections  being made to the Kerberos server, since the user's TGT and "ldap"  session key are valid for multiple uses for the several hours of the  ticket lifetime.

### 15.3.2. SASL Authorization Identities

The SASL authorization identity is sent to the LDAP server via the `-X` switch for *ldapsearch*(1) and other tools, or in the `*authzid` parameter to the *lutil_sasl_defaults*() call. The identity can be in one of two forms, either

```
        u:<username>
```

or

```
        dn:<dn>
```

In the first form, the <username> is from the same namespace as the authentication identities above. It is the user's username as it is referred to by the underlying authentication mechanism. Authorization  identities of this form are converted into a DN format by the same  function that the authentication process used, producing an *authorization request DN* of the form

```
        uid=<username>,cn=<realm>,cn=<mechanism>,cn=auth
```

That authorization request DN is then run through the same `authz-regexp` process to convert it into a legitimate authorization DN from the  database. If it cannot be converted due to a failed search from an LDAP  URL, the authorization request fails with "inappropriate access".   Otherwise, the DN string is now a legitimate authorization DN ready to  undergo approval.

If the authorization identity was provided in the second form, with a `"dn:"` prefix, the string after the prefix is already in authorization DN form, ready to undergo approval.

### 15.3.3. Proxy Authorization Rules

Once slapd has the authorization DN, the actual approval process  begins. There are two attributes that the LDAP administrator can put  into LDAP entries to allow authorization:

```
        authzTo
        authzFrom
```

Both can be multivalued.  The `authzTo` attribute is a source  rule, and it is placed into the entry associated with the authentication DN to tell what authorization DNs the authenticated DN is allowed to  assume.  The second attribute is a destination rule, and it is placed  into the entry associated with the requested authorization DN to tell  which authenticated DNs may assume it.

The choice of which authorization policy attribute to use is up to  the administrator.  Source rules are checked first in the person's  authentication DN entry, and if none of the `authzTo` rules specify the authorization is permitted, the `authzFrom` rules in the authorization DN entry are then checked. If neither case  specifies that the request be honored, the request is denied. Since the  default behavior is to deny authorization requests, rules only specify  that a request be allowed; there are no negative rules telling what  authorizations to deny.

The value(s) in the two attributes are of the same form as the output of the replacement pattern of a `authz-regexp` directive: either a DN or an LDAP URL. For example, if a `authzTo` value is a DN, that DN is one the authenticated user can authorize to. On the other hand, if the `authzTo` value is an LDAP URL, the URL is used as an internal search of the LDAP database, and the authenticated user can become ANY DN returned by the  search. If an LDAP entry looked like:

```
        dn: cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com
        authzTo: ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectclass=person)
```

then any user who authenticated as `cn=WebUpdate,dc=example,dc=com` could authorize to any other LDAP entry under the search base `dc=example,dc=com` which has an objectClass of `Person`.

#### 15.3.3.1. Notes on Proxy Authorization Rules

An LDAP URL in a `authzTo` or `authzFrom` attribute  will return a set of DNs.  Each DN returned will be checked.  Searches  which return a large set can cause the authorization process to take an  uncomfortably long time. Also, searches should be performed on  attributes that have been indexed by slapd.

To help produce more sweeping rules for `authzFrom` and `authzTo`, the values of these attributes are allowed to be DNs with regular expression characters in them. This means a source rule like

```
        authzTo: dn.regex:^uid=[^,]*,dc=example,dc=com$
```

would allow that authenticated user to authorize to any DN that  matches the regular expression pattern given. This regular expression  comparison can be evaluated much faster than an LDAP search for `(uid=*)`.

Also note that the values in an authorization rule must be one of the two forms: an LDAP URL or a DN (with or without regular expression  characters). Anything that does not begin with "`ldap://`" is taken as a DN. It is not permissible to enter another authorization identity of the form "`u:<username>`" as an authorization rule.

#### 15.3.3.2. Policy Configuration

The decision of which type of rules to use, `authzFrom` or `authzTo`, will depend on the site's situation. For example, if the set of people  who may become a given identity can easily be written as a search  filter, then a single destination rule could be written. If the set of  people is not easily defined by a search filter, and the set of people  is small, it may be better to write a source rule in the entries of each of those people who should be allowed to perform the proxy  authorization.

By default, processing of proxy authorization rules is disabled. The `authz-policy` directive must be set in the *slapd.conf*(5) file to enable authorization. This directive can be set to `none` for no rules (the default), `to` for source rules, `from` for destination rules, or `both` for both source and destination rules.

Source rules are extremely powerful. If ordinary users have access to write the `authzTo` attribute in their own entries, then they can write rules that would  allow them to authorize as anyone else.  As such, when using source  rules, the `authzTo` attribute should be protected with an ACL that only allows privileged users to set its values.

#### 15.3.3.3. Access Control requirements

When checking whether a particular DN may authorize as another DN, the server applies access control rules to the `authzTo` and `authzFrom` attributes. The `auth` privilege is required for an attribute to be used.

For example, suppose Alice has authenticated using her own ID and  password, and wants to perform an LDAP operation using Bob's  permissions. If authorization is granted by an `authzTo` attribute in Alice's entry then Alice needs the `auth` privilege on that attribute. Similarly, if authorization is granted by an `authzFrom` attribute in Bob's entry then Alice needs the `auth` privilege on that. Alice does not need any other access privilege to do a proxy operation.

# 16. Using TLS

OpenLDAP clients and servers are capable of using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) framework to provide integrity and confidentiality protections and to support LDAP authentication using the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism. TLS is defined in [RFC4346](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4346.txt).

## 16.1. TLS Certificates

TLS uses X.509 certificates to carry client and server  identities.  All servers are required to have valid certificates,  whereas client certificates are optional.  Clients must have a valid  certificate in order to authenticate via SASL EXTERNAL. For more  information on creating and managing certificates, see the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) or [GnuTLS](https://gnutls.org/) documentation, depending on which TLS implementation libraries you are using.

### 16.1.1. Server Certificates

The DN of a server certificate must use the `CN` attribute to name the server, and the `CN` must carry the server's fully qualified domain name. Additional alias names and wildcards may be present in the `subjectAltName` certificate extension.  More details on server certificate names are in [RFC4513](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4513.txt).

### 16.1.2. Client Certificates

The DN of a client certificate can be used directly as an authentication DN. Since X.509 is a part of the X.500 standard and LDAP is also based on X.500, both use the same DN formats  and generally the DN in a user's X.509 certificate should be identical  to the DN of their LDAP entry. However, sometimes the DNs may not be  exactly the same, and so the mapping facility described in [Mapping Authentication Identities](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#Mapping Authentication Identities) can be applied to these DNs as well.

------

## 16.2. TLS Configuration

After obtaining the required certificates, a number of options must  be configured on both the client and the server to enable TLS and make  use of the certificates.  At a minimum, the clients must be configured  with the name of the file containing all of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates it will trust. The server must be configured with the CA certificates and also its own server certificate and private key.

Typically a single CA will have issued the server certificate and all of the trusted client certificates, so the server only needs to trust  that one signing CA. However, a client may wish to connect to a variety  of secure servers managed by different organizations, with server  certificates generated by many different CAs. As such, a client is  likely to need a list of many different trusted CAs in its  configuration.

### 16.2.1. Server Configuration

The configuration directives for slapd belong in the global directives section of *slapd.conf*(5).

#### 16.2.1.1. TLSCACertificateFile <filename>

This directive specifies the PEM-format file containing  certificates for the CA's that slapd will trust. The certificate for the CA that signed the server certificate must be included among these  certificates. If the signing CA was not a top-level (root) CA,  certificates for the entire sequence of CA's from the signing CA to the  top-level CA should be present. Multiple certificates are simply  appended to the file; the order is not significant.

#### 16.2.1.2. TLSCACertificatePath <path>

This directive specifies the path of a directory that contains individual CA certificates in separate files.  In addition, this directory must be specially managed using the OpenSSL *rehash* command. When using this feature, the OpenSSL library will attempt to  locate certificate files based on a hash of their name and serial  number. The OpenSSL *rehash* command is used to generate symbolic links with the hashed names that point to the actual certificate files. As such, this option can only be used with a filesystem that actually  supports symbolic links. In general, it is simpler to use the `TLSCACertificateFile` directive instead.

#### 16.2.1.3. TLSCertificateFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the slapd server  certificate. Certificates are generally public information and require  no special protection.

#### 16.2.1.4. TLSCertificateKeyFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the `TLSCertificateFile` file. Private keys themselves are sensitive data and are usually  password encrypted for protection. However, the current implementation  doesn't support encrypted keys so the key must not be encrypted and the  file itself must be protected carefully.

#### 16.2.1.5. TLSCipherSuite <cipher-suite-spec>

This directive configures what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order. `<cipher-suite-spec>` should be a cipher specification for OpenSSL. You can use the command

```
        openssl ciphers -v ALL
```

to obtain a verbose list of available cipher specifications.

Besides the individual cipher names, the specifiers `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `EXPORT`, and `EXPORT40` may be helpful, along with `TLSv1`, `SSLv3`, and `SSLv2`.

To obtain the list of ciphers in GnuTLS use:

```
        gnutls-cli -l
```

#### 16.2.1.6. TLSRandFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file to obtain random bits from when `/dev/urandom` is not available. If the system provides `/dev/urandom` then this option is not needed, otherwise a source of random data must be configured.  Some systems (e.g. Linux) provide `/dev/urandom` by default, while others (e.g. Solaris) require the installation of a  patch to provide it, and others may not support it at all. In the latter case, EGD or PRNGD should be installed, and this directive should  specify the name of the EGD/PRNGD socket. The environment variable `RANDFILE` can also be used to specify the filename. Also, in the absence of these options, the `.rnd` file in the slapd user's home directory may be used if it exists. To use the `.rnd` file, just create the file and copy a few hundred bytes of arbitrary  data into the file. The file is only used to provide a seed for the  pseudo-random number generator, and it doesn't need very much data to  work.

This directive is ignored with GnuTLS.

#### 16.2.1.7. TLSDHParamFile <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains parameters for  Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This is required in order to use DHE-based cipher suites, including all DSA-based suites (i.e. `TLSCertificateKeyFile` points to a DSA key), and RSA when the 'key encipherment' key usage is  not specified in the certificate.  Parameters can be generated using the following command

```
        openssl dhparam [-dsaparam] -out <filename> <numbits> or
        certtool --generate-dh-params --bits <numbits> --outfile <filename>
```

#### 16.2.1.8. TLSECName <name>

This directive specifies the curve to use for Elliptic Curve  Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This option is only needed to  use ECDHE-based cipher suites in OpenSSL.  The names of supported curves may be shown using the following command

```
        openssl ecparam -list_curves
```

See the OpenSSL documentation for details. This directive is not used for GnuTLS. For GnuTLS the curves may be specified in the ciphersuite.

#### 16.2.1.9. TLSVerifyClient { never | allow | try | demand }

This directive specifies what checks to perform on client  certificates in an incoming TLS session, if any. This option is set to `never` by default, in which case the server never asks the client for a certificate. With a setting of `allow` the server will ask for a client certificate; if none is provided the  session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided but the server  is unable to verify it, the certificate is ignored and the session  proceeds normally, as if no certificate had been provided. With a  setting of `try` the certificate is requested, and if none is  provided, the session proceeds normally. If a certificate is provided  and it cannot be verified, the session is immediately terminated. With a setting of `demand` the certificate is requested and a valid certificate must be provided, otherwise the session is immediately terminated.



------

**Note:** The server must request a client certificate in  order to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a TLS  session. As such, a non-default `TLSVerifyClient` setting must be configured before SASL EXTERNAL authentication may be attempted, and  the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism will only be offered to the client if a  valid client certificate was received.

------



### 16.2.2. Client Configuration

Most of the client configuration directives parallel the server  directives. The names of the directives are different, and they go into *ldap.conf*(5) instead of *slapd.conf*(5), but their functionality is mostly the same. Also, while most of these  options may be configured on a system-wide basis, they may all be  overridden by individual users in their *.ldaprc* files.

The LDAP Start TLS operation is used in LDAP to initiate TLS negotiation.  All OpenLDAP command line tools support a `-Z` and `-ZZ` flag to indicate whether a Start TLS operation is to be issued.  The  latter flag indicates that the tool is to cease processing if TLS cannot be started while the former allows the command to continue.

In LDAPv2 environments, TLS is normally started using the LDAP Secure URI scheme (`ldaps://`) instead of the normal LDAP URI scheme (`ldap://`).  OpenLDAP command line tools allow either scheme to used with the `-H` flag and with the `URI` *ldap.conf*(5) option.

#### 16.2.2.1. TLS_CACERT <filename>

This is equivalent to the server's `TLSCACertificateFile` option. As noted in the [TLS Configuration](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/tls.html#TLS Configuration) section, a client typically may need to know about more CAs than a server, but otherwise the same considerations apply.

#### 16.2.2.2. TLS_CACERTDIR <path>

This is equivalent to the server's `TLSCACertificatePath` option. The specified directory must be managed with the OpenSSL *rehash* command as well.

#### 16.2.2.3. TLS_CERT <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the client  certificate. This is a user-only directive and can only be specified in a user's *.ldaprc* file.

#### 16.2.2.4. TLS_KEY <filename>

This directive specifies the file that contains the private key that matches the certificate stored in the `TLS_CERT` file. The same constraints mentioned for `TLSCertificateKeyFile` apply here. This is also a user-only directive.

#### 16.2.2.5. TLS_RANDFILE <filename>

This directive is the same as the server's `TLSRandFile` option.

#### 16.2.2.6. TLS_REQCERT { never | allow | try | demand }

This directive is equivalent to the server's `TLSVerifyClient` option. However, for clients the default value is `demand` and there generally is no good reason to change this setting.

# 17. Constructing a Distributed Directory Service

For many sites, running one or more *slapd*(8) that hold an entire subtree of data is sufficient. But often it is desirable to have one *slapd* refer to other directory services for a certain part of the tree (which may or may not be running *slapd*).

*slapd* supports *subordinate* and *superior* knowledge information. Subordinate knowledge information is held in `referral` objects ([RFC3296](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3296.txt)).

------

## 17.1. Subordinate Knowledge Information

Subordinate knowledge information may be provided to delegate a  subtree. Subordinate knowledge information is maintained in the  directory as a special *referral* object at the delegate point.  The referral object acts as a delegation point, gluing two services  together. This mechanism allows for hierarchical directory services to  be constructed.

A referral object has a structural object class of `referral` and has the same Distinguished Name as the delegated subtree.  Generally, the referral object will also provide the auxiliary object class `extensibleObject`. This allows the entry to contain appropriate Relative Distinguished Name values.  This is best demonstrated by example.

If the server `a.example.net` holds `dc=example,dc=net` and wished to delegate the subtree `ou=subtree,dc=example,dc=net` to another server `b.example.net`, the following named referral object would be added to `a.example.net`:

```
        dn: dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=net
        objectClass: referral
        objectClass: extensibleObject
        dc: subtree
        ref: ldap://b.example.net/dc=subtree,dc=example,dc=net
```

The server uses this information to generate referrals and search continuations to subordinate servers.

For those familiar with X.500, a *named referral* object is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a *subr* DSE.

------

## 17.2. Superior Knowledge Information

Superior knowledge information may be specified using the `referral` directive.  The value is a list of URIs referring to superior directory services.  For servers without immediate superiors, such as for `a.example.net` in the example above, the server can be configured to use a directory service with *global knowledge*, such as the *OpenLDAP Root Service* (http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=393).

```
        referral        ldap://root.openldap.org/
```

However, as `a.example.net` is the *immediate superior* to `b.example.net`, *b.example.net* would be configured as follows:

```
        referral        ldap://a.example.net/
```

The server uses this information to generate referrals for operations acting upon entries not within or subordinate to any of the naming  contexts held by the server.

For those familiar with X.500, this use of the `ref` attribute is similar to an X.500 knowledge reference held in a *Supr* DSE.

------

## 17.3. The ManageDsaIT Control

Adding, modifying, and deleting referral objects is generally done using *ldapmodify*(1) or similar tools which support the ManageDsaIT control.  The  ManageDsaIT control informs the server that you intend to manage the  referral object as a regular entry.  This keeps the server from sending a referral result for requests which interrogate or update referral  objects.

The ManageDsaIT control should not be specified when managing regular entries.

The `-M` option of *ldapmodify*(1) (and other tools) enables ManageDsaIT.  For example:

```
        ldapmodify -M -f referral.ldif -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=net" -W
```

or with *ldapsearch*(1):

```
        ldapsearch -M -b "dc=example,dc=net" -x "(objectclass=referral)" '*' ref
```



------

**Note:** the `ref` attribute is operational and must be explicitly requested when desired in search results.

------





------

**Note:** the use of referrals to construct a Distributed  Directory Service is extremely clumsy and not well supported by common  clients. If an existing installation has already been built using  referrals, the use of the *chain* overlay to hide the referrals  will greatly improve the usability of the Directory system. A better  approach would be to use explicitly defined local and proxy databases in *subordinate* configurations to provide a seamless view of the Distributed Directory.

------





------

**Note:** LDAP operations, even subtree searches, normally  access only one database. That can be changed by gluing databases  together with the **subordinate**/**olcSubordinate** keyword. Please see *slapd.conf*(5) and *slapd-config*(5).

# 18. Replication

Replicated directories are a fundamental requirement for delivering a resilient enterprise deployment.

[OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) has various  configuration options for creating a replicated directory. In previous  releases, replication was discussed in terms of a *master* server and some number of *slave* servers. A master accepted directory updates from other clients, and a  slave only accepted updates from a (single) master. The replication  structure was rigidly defined and any particular database could only  fulfill a single role, either master or slave. Another historic term  introduced with OpenLDAP 2.4 was multimaster.

As OpenLDAP now supports a wide variety of replication topologies, these terms have been deprecated in favor of *provider*/*multi-provider* and *consumer*: A provider can accept external write operations and make them available for retrieval by consumers; consumers request replication updates from  providers. Unlike the rigidly defined master/slave relationships,  provider/consumer roles are quite fluid: replication updates received in a consumer can be further propagated by that consumer to other servers, so a consumer can also act simultaneously as a provider. Also, a  consumer need not be an actual LDAP server; it may be just an LDAP  client.

The following sections will describe the replication technology and discuss the various replication options that are available.

------

## 18.1. Replication Technology

### 18.1.1. LDAP Sync Replication

The LDAP Sync Replication engine, syncrepl for short, is a consumer-side replication engine that enables the consumer LDAP server to maintain a shadow copy of a DIT fragment. A syncrepl engine resides at the consumer and executes as one of the *slapd*(8) threads. It creates and maintains a replica by connecting to the  replication provider to perform the initial DIT content load followed  either by periodic content polling or by timely updates upon content  changes.

Syncrepl uses the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol (or LDAP Sync for short) as the consumer synchronization protocol.  LDAP Sync  provides a stateful replication which supports both pull-based and  push-based synchronization and does not mandate the use of a history  store. In pull-based replication the consumer periodically polls the  provider for updates. In push-based replication the consumer listens for updates that are sent by the provider in realtime. Since the protocol  does not require a history store, the provider does not need to maintain any log of updates it has received (Note that the syncrepl engine is  extensible and additional replication protocols may be supported in the  future.).

Syncrepl keeps track of the status of the replication content by  maintaining and exchanging synchronization cookies. Because the syncrepl consumer and provider maintain their content status, the consumer can  poll the provider content to perform incremental synchronization by  asking for the entries required to make the consumer up-to-date with the provider content. Syncrepl also enables convenient management of  consumers by maintaining replication status.  The consumer database can  be constructed from a consumer-side or a provider-side backup at any  synchronization status. Syncrepl can automatically resynchronize the  consumer database to be up-to-date with the current provider content.

Syncrepl supports both pull-based and push-based synchronization. In  its basic refreshOnly synchronization mode, the provider uses pull-based synchronization where the consumer servers need not be tracked and no  history information is maintained.  The information required for the  provider to process periodic polling requests is contained in the  synchronization cookie of the request itself.  To optimize the  pull-based synchronization, syncrepl utilizes the present phase of the  LDAP Sync protocol as well as its delete phase, instead of falling back  on frequent full reloads. To further optimize the pull-based  synchronization, the provider can maintain a per-scope session log as a  history store. In its refreshAndPersist mode of synchronization, the  provider uses a push-based synchronization. The provider keeps track of  the consumer servers that have requested a persistent search and sends  them necessary updates as the provider replication content gets  modified.

With syncrepl, a consumer can create a replication agreement without  changing the provider's configurations and without restarting the  provider server, if the consumer server has appropriate access  privileges for the DIT fragment to be replicated. The consumer server  can stop the replication also without the need for provider-side changes and restart.

Syncrepl supports both types of partial replication: sparse and  fractional The shadow DIT fragment is defined by a general search  criteria consisting of base, scope, filter, and attribute list.  The  consumer content is also subject to the access privileges of the bind  identity of the syncrepl replication connection.

Fractional replication uses explicit attribute lists to replicate  only a subset of the provider's attributes and sparse replication uses  base/scope/filter to replicate only a subset of the provider's entries.  Both cases are just refinements of the general search criteria.

#### 18.1.1.1. The LDAP Content Synchronization Protocol

The LDAP Sync protocol allows a client to maintain a synchronized  copy of a DIT fragment. The LDAP Sync operation is defined as a set of  controls and other protocol elements which extend the LDAP search  operation. This section introduces the LDAP Content Sync protocol only  briefly.  For more information, refer to [RFC4533](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt).

The LDAP Sync protocol supports both polling and listening for changes by defining two respective synchronization operations: *refreshOnly* and *refreshAndPersist*.  Polling is implemented by the *refreshOnly* operation. The consumer polls the provider using an LDAP Search request with an LDAP Sync control attached. The consumer copy is synchronized  to the provider copy at the time of polling using the information  returned in the search.  The provider finishes the search operation by  returning *SearchResultDone* at the end of the search operation as in the normal search.  Listening is implemented by the *refreshAndPersist* operation. As the name implies, it begins with a search, like  refreshOnly. Instead of finishing the search after returning all entries currently matching the search criteria, the synchronization search  remains persistent in the provider. Subsequent updates to the  synchronization content in the provider cause additional entry updates  to be sent to the consumer.

The *refreshOnly* operation and the refresh stage of the *refreshAndPersist* operation can be performed with a present phase or a delete phase.

In the present phase, the provider sends the consumer the entries  updated within the search scope since the last synchronization. The  provider sends all requested attributes, be they changed or not, of the  updated entries.  For each unchanged entry which remains in the scope,  the provider sends a present message consisting only of the name of the  entry and the synchronization control representing state present. The  present message does not contain any attributes of the entry. After the  consumer receives all update and present entries, it can reliably  determine the new consumer copy by adding the entries added to the  provider, by replacing the entries modified at the provider, and by  deleting entries in the consumer copy which have not been updated nor  specified as being present at the provider.

The transmission of the updated entries in the delete phase is the  same as in the present phase. The provider sends all the requested  attributes of the entries updated within the search scope since the last synchronization to the consumer. In the delete phase, however, the  provider sends a delete message for each entry deleted from the search  scope, instead of sending present messages.  The delete message consists only of the name of the entry and the synchronization control  representing state delete.  The new consumer copy can be determined by  adding, modifying, and removing entries according to the synchronization control attached to the *SearchResultEntry* message.

In the case that the LDAP Sync provider maintains a history store and can determine which entries are scoped out of the consumer copy since  the last synchronization time, the provider can use the delete phase. If the provider does not maintain any history store, cannot determine the  scoped-out entries from the history store, or the history store does not cover the outdated synchronization state of the consumer, the provider  should use the present phase.  The use of the present phase is much more efficient than a full content reload in terms of the synchronization  traffic.  To reduce the synchronization traffic further, the LDAP Sync  protocol also provides several optimizations such as the transmission of the normalized `entryUUID`s and the transmission of multiple `entryUUIDs` in a single *syncIdSet* message.

At the end of the *refreshOnly* synchronization, the provider  sends a synchronization cookie to the consumer as a state indicator of  the consumer copy after the synchronization is completed.  The consumer  will present the received cookie when it requests the next incremental  synchronization to the provider.

When *refreshAndPersist* synchronization is used, the provider sends a synchronization cookie at the end of the refresh stage by  sending a Sync Info message with refreshDone=TRUE.  It also sends a  synchronization cookie by attaching it to *SearchResultEntry*  messages generated in the persist stage of the synchronization search.  During the persist stage, the provider can also send a Sync Info message containing the synchronization cookie at any time the provider wants to update the consumer-side state indicator.

In the LDAP Sync protocol, entries are uniquely identified by the `entryUUID` attribute value. It can function as a reliable identifier of the entry. The DN of the entry, on the other hand, can be changed over time and  hence cannot be considered as the reliable identifier.  The `entryUUID` is attached to each *SearchResultEntry* or *SearchResultReference* as a part of the synchronization control.

#### 18.1.1.2. Syncrepl Details

The syncrepl engine utilizes both the *refreshOnly* and the *refreshAndPersist* operations of the LDAP Sync protocol.  If a syncrepl specification is included in a database definition, *slapd*(8) launches a syncrepl engine as a *slapd*(8) thread and schedules its execution. If the *refreshOnly* operation is specified, the syncrepl engine will be rescheduled at the  interval time after a synchronization operation is completed.  If the *refreshAndPersist* operation is specified, the engine will remain active and process the persistent synchronization messages from the provider.

The syncrepl engine utilizes both the present phase and the delete  phase of the refresh synchronization. It is possible to configure a  session log in the provider which stores the `entryUUID`s of a  finite number of entries deleted from a database. Multiple consumers  share the same session log. The syncrepl engine uses the delete phase if the session log is present and the state of the consumer server is  recent enough that no session log entries are truncated after the last  synchronization of the client.  The syncrepl engine uses the present  phase if no session log is configured for the replication content or if  the consumer is too outdated to be covered by the session log.  The  current design of the session log store is memory based, so the  information contained in the session log is not persistent over multiple provider invocations. It is not currently supported to access the  session log store by using LDAP operations. It is also not currently  supported to impose access control to the session log.

As a further optimization, even in the case the synchronization  search is not associated with any session log, no entries will be  transmitted to the consumer server when there has been no update in the  replication context.

The syncrepl engine, which is a consumer-side replication engine, can work with any backends. The LDAP Sync provider can be configured as an  overlay on any backend, but works best with the *back-mdb* backend.

The LDAP Sync provider maintains a `contextCSN` for each database as the current synchronization state indicator of the provider content.  It is the largest `entryCSN` in the provider context such that no transactions for an entry having smaller `entryCSN` value remains outstanding.  The `contextCSN` could not just be set to the largest issued `entryCSN` because `entryCSN` is obtained before a transaction starts and transactions are not committed in the issue order.

The provider stores the `contextCSN` of a context in the `contextCSN` attribute of the context suffix entry. The attribute is not written to  the database after every update operation though; instead it is  maintained primarily in memory. At database start time the provider  reads the last saved `contextCSN` into memory and uses the in-memory copy exclusively thereafter. By default, changes to the `contextCSN` as a result of database updates will not be written to the database  until the server is cleanly shut down. A checkpoint facility exists to  cause the `contextCSN` to be written out more frequently if desired.

Note that at startup time, if the provider is unable to read a `contextCSN` from the suffix entry, it will scan the entire database to determine  the value, and this scan may take quite a long time on a large database. When a `contextCSN` value is read, the database will still be scanned for any `entryCSN` values greater than it, to make sure the `contextCSN` value truly reflects the greatest committed `entryCSN` in the database. On databases which support inequality indexing, setting an eq index on the `entryCSN` attribute and configuring *contextCSN* checkpoints will greatly speed up this scanning step.

If no `contextCSN` can be determined by reading and scanning  the database, a new value will be generated. Also, if scanning the  database yielded a greater `entryCSN` than was previously recorded in the suffix entry's `contextCSN` attribute, a checkpoint will be immediately written with the new value.

The consumer also stores its replication state, which is the provider's `contextCSN` received as a synchronization cookie, in the `contextCSN` attribute of the suffix entry.  The replication state maintained by a  consumer server is used as the synchronization state indicator when it  performs subsequent incremental synchronization with the provider  server. It is also used as a provider-side synchronization state  indicator when it functions as a secondary provider server in a  cascading replication configuration.  Since the consumer and provider  state information are maintained in the same location within their  respective databases, any consumer can be promoted to a provider (and  vice versa) without any special actions.

Because a general search filter can be used in the syncrepl  specification, some entries in the context may be omitted from the  synchronization content.  The syncrepl engine creates a glue entry to  fill in the holes in the consumer context if any part of the consumer  content is subordinate to the holes. The glue entries will not be  returned in the search result unless *ManageDsaIT* control is provided.

Also as a consequence of the search filter used in the syncrepl  specification, it is possible for a modification to remove an entry from the replication scope even though the entry has not been deleted on the provider. Logically the entry must be deleted on the consumer but in *refreshOnly* mode the provider cannot detect and propagate this change without the use of the session log on the provider.

For configuration, please see the [Syncrepl](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Syncrepl) section.

## 18.2. Deployment Alternatives

While the LDAP Sync specification only defines a narrow scope for  replication, the OpenLDAP implementation is extremely flexible and  supports a variety of operating modes to handle other scenarios not  explicitly addressed in the spec.

### 18.2.1. Delta-syncrepl replication

- Disadvantages of LDAP Sync replication:

LDAP Sync replication is an object-based replication mechanism. When  any attribute value in a replicated object is changed on the provider,  each consumer fetches and processes the complete changed object,  including **both the changed and unchanged attribute values** during  replication. One advantage of this approach is that when multiple  changes occur to a single object, the precise sequence of those changes  need not be preserved; only the final state of the entry is significant. But this approach may have drawbacks when the usage pattern involves  single changes to multiple objects.

For example, suppose you have a database consisting of 102,400  objects of 1 KB each. Further, suppose you routinely run a batch job to  change the value of a single two-byte attribute value that appears in  each of the 102,400 objects on the provider. Not counting LDAP and  TCP/IP protocol overhead, each time you run this job each consumer will  transfer and process **100 MB** of data to process **200KB of changes!**

99.98% of the data that is transmitted and processed in a case like  this will be redundant, since it represents values that did not change.  This is a waste of valuable transmission and processing bandwidth and  can cause an unacceptable replication backlog to develop. While this  situation is extreme, it serves to demonstrate a very real problem that  is encountered in some LDAP deployments.

- Where Delta-syncrepl comes in:

Delta-syncrepl, a changelog-based variant of syncrepl, is designed to address situations like the one described above. Delta-syncrepl works  by maintaining a changelog of a selectable depth in a separate database  on the provider. The replication consumer checks the changelog for the  changes it needs and, as long as the changelog contains the needed  changes, the consumer fetches the changes from the changelog and applies them to its database. If, however, a consumer is too far out of sync  (or completely empty), conventional syncrepl is used to bring it up to  date and replication then switches back to the delta-syncrepl mode.



------

**Note:** since the database state is stored in both the  changelog DB and the main DB on the provider, it is important to  backup/restore both the changelog DB and the main DB using  slapcat/slapadd when restoring a DB or copying it to another machine.

For configuration, please see the [Delta-syncrepl](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Delta-syncrepl) section.

### 18.2.2. N-Way Multi-Provider Replication

Multi-Provider replication is a replication technique using Syncrepl  to replicate data to multiple provider ("Provider") Directory servers.

#### 18.2.2.1. Valid Arguments for Multi-Provider replication

- If any provider fails, other providers will continue to accept updates
- Avoids a single point of failure
- Providers can be located in several physical sites i.e. distributed across the network/globe.
- Good for Automatic failover/High Availability

#### 18.2.2.2. Invalid Arguments for Multi-Provider replication

(These are often claimed to be advantages of Multi-Provider replication but those claims are false):

- It has **NOTHING** to do with load balancing
- Providers **must** propagate writes to **all** the other  servers, which means the network traffic and write load spreads across  all of the servers the same as for single-provider.
- Server utilization and performance are at best identical for  Multi-Provider and Single-Provider replication; at worst Single-Provider is superior because indexing can be tuned differently to optimize for  the different usage patterns between the provider and the consumers.

#### 18.2.2.3. Arguments against Multi-Provider replication

- Breaks the data consistency guarantees of the directory model
- http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1240.html
- If connectivity with a provider is lost because of a network partition, then "automatic failover" can just compound the problem
- Typically, a particular machine cannot distinguish between  losing contact with a peer because that peer crashed, or because the  network link has failed
- If a network is partitioned and multiple clients start writing  to each of the "providers" then reconciliation will be a pain; it may be best to simply deny writes to the clients that are partitioned from the single provider

For configuration, please see the [N-Way Multi-Provider](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#N-Way Multi-Provider) section below

### 18.2.3. Mirror mode replication

Mirror mode is a hybrid configuration that provides all of the  consistency guarantees of single-provider replication, while also  providing the high availability of multi-provider. In Mirror mode two  providers are set up to replicate from each other (as a multi-provider  configuration), but an external frontend is employed to direct all  writes to only one of the two servers. The second provider will only be  used for writes if the first provider crashes, at which point the  frontend will switch to directing all writes to the second provider.  When a crashed provider is repaired and restarted it will automatically  catch up to any changes on the running provider and resync.

#### 18.2.3.1. Arguments for Mirror mode

- Provides a high-availability (HA) solution for directory writes (replicas handle reads)
- As long as one provider is operational, writes can safely be accepted
- Provider nodes replicate from each other, so they are always up to date and can be ready to take over (hot standby)
- Syncrepl also allows the provider nodes to re-synchronize after any downtime

#### 18.2.3.2. Arguments against Mirror mode

- Mirror mode is not what is termed as a Multi-Provider solution. This is because writes have to go to just one of the mirror nodes at a time
- Mirror mode can be termed as Active-Active Hot-Standby,  therefore an external server (slapd in proxy mode) or device (hardware  load balancer) is needed to manage which provider is currently active
- Backups are managed slightly differently

For configuration, please see the [Mirror mode](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Mirror mode) section below

### 18.2.4. Syncrepl Proxy Mode

While the LDAP Sync protocol supports both pull- and push-based  replication, the push mode (refreshAndPersist) must still be initiated  from the consumer before the provider can begin pushing changes. In some network configurations, particularly where firewalls restrict the  direction in which connections can be made, a provider-initiated push  mode may be needed.

This mode can be configured with the aid of the LDAP Backend ([Backends](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/backends.html) and *slapd-ldap(8)*). Instead of running the syncrepl engine on the actual consumer, a  slapd-ldap proxy is set up near (or collocated with) the provider that  points to the consumer, and the syncrepl engine runs on the proxy.

For configuration, please see the [Syncrepl Proxy](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Syncrepl Proxy) section.

------

## 18.3. Configuring the different replication types

### 18.3.1. Syncrepl

#### 18.3.1.1. Syncrepl configuration

Because syncrepl is a consumer-side replication engine, the syncrepl specification is defined in *slapd.conf*(5) of the consumer server, not in the provider server's configuration  file.  The initial loading of the consumer content can be performed  either by starting the syncrepl engine with no synchronization cookie or by populating the consumer by loading an LDIF file dumped as a backup at the provider.

When loading from a backup, it is not required to perform the initial loading from the up-to-date backup of the provider content. The  syncrepl engine will automatically synchronize the initial consumer to  the current provider content. As a result, it is not required to stop  the provider server in order to avoid the replication inconsistency  caused by the updates to the provider content during the content backup  and loading process.

When replicating a large scale directory, especially in a bandwidth  constrained environment, it is advised to load the consumer from a  backup instead of performing a full initial load using syncrepl.

#### 18.3.1.2. Set up the provider slapd

The provider is implemented as an overlay, so the overlay itself must first be configured in *slapd.conf*(5) before it can be used. The provider has two primary configuration  directives and two secondary directives for when delta-syncrepl is being used. Because the LDAP Sync search is subject to access control, proper access control privileges should be set up for the replicated content.

The two primary options to configure are the checkpoint and sessionlog behaviors.

The `contextCSN` checkpoint is configured by the

```
        syncprov-checkpoint <ops> <minutes>
```

directive. Checkpoints are only tested after successful write operations. If *<ops>* operations or more than *<minutes>* time has passed since the last checkpoint, a new checkpoint is performed. Checkpointing is disabled by default.

The session log is configured by the

```
        syncprov-sessionlog <ops>
```

directive, where *<ops>* is the maximum number of  session log entries the session log can record. All write operations  (except Adds) are recorded in the log.

Note that using the session log requires searching on the *entryUUID* attribute. Setting an eq index on this attribute will greatly benefit the performance of the session log on the provider.

The reloadhint option is configured by the

```
        syncprov-reloadhint <TRUE|FALSE>
```

directive. It must be set TRUE when using the accesslog overlay for  delta-based syncrepl replication support. The default is FALSE.

The nonpresent option is configured by the

```
        syncprov-nopresent <TRUE|FALSE>
```

directive. This value should only be set TRUE for a syncprov instance on top of a log database (such as one managed by the accesslog  overlay). The default is FALSE.

A more complete example of the *slapd.conf*(5) content is thus:

```
        database mdb
        maxsize 1073741824
        suffix dc=Example,dc=com
        rootdn dc=Example,dc=com
        directory /var/ldap/db
        index objectclass,entryCSN,entryUUID eq

        overlay syncprov
        syncprov-checkpoint 100 10
        syncprov-sessionlog 100
```

#### 18.3.1.3. Set up the consumer slapd

The syncrepl directive is specified in the database section of *slapd.conf*(5) for the consumer context. The syncrepl engine is backend independent  and the directive can be defined with any database type.

```
        database mdb
        maxsize 1073741824
        suffix dc=Example,dc=com
        rootdn dc=Example,dc=com
        directory /var/ldap/db
        index objectclass,entryCSN,entryUUID eq

        syncrepl rid=123
                provider=ldap://provider.example.com:389
                type=refreshOnly
                interval=01:00:00:00
                searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                filter="(objectClass=organizationalPerson)"
                scope=sub
                attrs="cn,sn,ou,telephoneNumber,title,l"
                schemachecking=off
                bindmethod=simple
                binddn="cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com"
                credentials=secret
```

In this example, the consumer will connect to the provider *slapd*(8) at port 389 of [ldap://provider.example.com](ldap://provider.example.com) to perform a polling (*refreshOnly*) mode of synchronization once a day.  It will bind as `cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com` using simple authentication with password "secret".  Note that the access control privilege of `cn=syncuser,dc=example,dc=com` should be set appropriately in the provider to retrieve the desired  replication content. Also the search limits must be high enough on the  provider to allow the syncuser to retrieve a complete copy of the  requested content.  The consumer uses the rootdn to write to its  database so it always has full permissions to write all content.

The synchronization search in the above example will search for the  entries whose objectClass is organizationalPerson in the entire subtree  rooted at `dc=example,dc=com`. The requested attributes are `cn`, `sn`, `ou`, `telephoneNumber`, `title`, and `l`. The schema checking is turned off, so that the consumer *slapd*(8) will not enforce entry schema checking when it processes updates from the provider *slapd*(8).

For more detailed information on the syncrepl directive, see the [syncrepl](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html#syncrepl) section of [The slapd Configuration File](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html) chapter of this admin guide.

#### 18.3.1.4. Start the provider and the consumer slapd

The provider *slapd*(8) is not required to be restarted. *contextCSN* is automatically generated as needed: it might be originally contained in the LDIF file, generated by *slapadd* (8), generated upon changes in the context, or generated when the first LDAP Sync search arrives at the provider.  If an LDIF file is being  loaded which did not previously contain the *contextCSN*, the *-w* option should be used with *slapadd* (8) to cause it to be generated. This will allow the server to startup a little quicker the first time it runs.

When starting a consumer *slapd*(8), it is possible to provide a synchronization cookie as the *-c cookie* command line option in order to start the synchronization from a  specific state.  The cookie is a comma separated list of name=value  pairs. Currently supported syncrepl cookie fields are *csn=<csn>* and *rid=<rid>*. *<csn>* represents the current synchronization state of the consumer. *<rid>* identifies a consumer locally within the consumer server. It is used to relate the cookie to the syncrepl definition in *slapd.conf*(5) which has the matching *<rid>*.  The *<rid>* must have no more than 3 decimal digits.  The command line cookie  overrides the synchronization cookie stored in the consumer database.

### 18.3.2. Delta-syncrepl

#### 18.3.2.1. Delta-syncrepl Provider configuration

Setting up delta-syncrepl requires configuration changes on both the provider and replica servers:

```
     # Give the replicator DN unlimited read access.  This ACL needs to be
     # merged with other ACL statements, and/or moved within the scope
     # of a database.  The "by * break" portion causes evaluation of
     # subsequent rules.  See slapd.access(5) for details.
     access to *
        by dn.base="cn=replicator,dc=example,dc=com" read
        by * break

     # Set the module path location
     modulepath /opt/symas/lib/openldap

     # Load the mdb backend
     moduleload back_mdb.la

     # Load the accesslog overlay
     moduleload accesslog.la

     #Load the syncprov overlay
     moduleload syncprov.la

     # Accesslog database definitions
     database mdb
     suffix cn=accesslog
     directory /db/accesslog
     rootdn cn=accesslog
     index default eq
     index entryCSN,objectClass,reqEnd,reqResult,reqStart,reqDN

     overlay syncprov
     syncprov-nopresent TRUE
     syncprov-reloadhint TRUE

     # Let the replicator DN have limitless searches
     limits dn.exact="cn=replicator,dc=example,dc=com" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited

     # Primary database definitions
     database mdb
     suffix "dc=symas,dc=com"
     rootdn "cn=manager,dc=symas,dc=com"

     ## Whatever other configuration options are desired

     # syncprov specific indexing
     index entryCSN eq
     index entryUUID eq

     # syncrepl Provider for primary db
     overlay syncprov
     syncprov-checkpoint 1000 60

     # accesslog overlay definitions for primary db
     overlay accesslog
     logdb cn=accesslog
     logops writes
     logsuccess TRUE
     # scan the accesslog DB every day, and purge entries older than 7 days
     logpurge 07+00:00 01+00:00

     # Let the replicator DN have limitless searches
     limits dn.exact="cn=replicator,dc=example,dc=com" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited
```

For more information, always consult the relevant man pages (*slapo-accesslog*(5) and *slapd.conf*(5))

#### 18.3.2.2. Delta-syncrepl Consumer configuration

```
     # Replica database configuration
     database mdb
     suffix "dc=symas,dc=com"
     rootdn "cn=manager,dc=symas,dc=com"

     ## Whatever other configuration bits for the replica, like indexing
     ## that you want

     # syncrepl specific indices
     index entryUUID eq

     # syncrepl directives
     syncrepl  rid=0
               provider=ldap://ldapprovider.example.com:389
               bindmethod=simple
               binddn="cn=replicator,dc=example,dc=com"
               credentials=secret
               searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
               logbase="cn=accesslog"
               logfilter="(&(objectClass=auditWriteObject)(reqResult=0))"
               schemachecking=on
               type=refreshAndPersist
               retry="60 +"
               syncdata=accesslog

     # Refer updates to the provider
     updateref               ldap://ldapprovider.example.com
```

The above configuration assumes that you have a replicator identity  defined in your database that can be used to bind to the provider.



------

**Note:** An accesslog database is unique to a given provider. It should never be replicated.

------



### 18.3.3. N-Way Multi-Provider

For the following example we will be using 3 Provider nodes. Keeping in line with **test050-syncrepl-multiprovider** of the OpenLDAP test suite, we will be configuring *slapd(8)* via **cn=config**

This sets up the config database:

```
     dn: cn=config
     objectClass: olcGlobal
     cn: config
     olcServerID: 1

     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     olcDatabase: {0}config
     olcRootPW: secret
```

Each server must have a unique server ID (`SID`), so second and third servers will have a different `olcServerID` obviously:

```
     dn: cn=config
     objectClass: olcGlobal
     cn: config
     olcServerID: 2

     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     olcDatabase: {0}config
     olcRootPW: secret
```

This sets up syncrepl as a provider (since these are all providers):

```
     dn: cn=module,cn=config
     objectClass: olcModuleList
     cn: module
     olcModulePath: /usr/local/libexec/openldap
     olcModuleLoad: syncprov.la
```

Now we setup the first Provider Node (replace $URI1, $URI2 and $URI3 etc. with your actual ldap urls):

```
     dn: cn=config
     changetype: modify
     replace: olcServerID
     olcServerID: 1 $URI1
     olcServerID: 2 $URI2
     olcServerID: 3 $URI3

     dn: olcOverlay=syncprov,olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     changetype: add
     objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
     objectClass: olcSyncProvConfig
     olcOverlay: syncprov

     dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
     changetype: modify
     add: olcSyncRepl
     olcSyncRepl: rid=001 provider=$URI1 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=002 provider=$URI2 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=003 provider=$URI3 binddn="cn=config" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=secret searchbase="cn=config" type=refreshAndPersist
       retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     -
     add: olcMultiProvider
     olcMultiProvider: TRUE
```

Now start up the provider and a consumer/s, also add the above LDIF  to the first consumer, second consumer etc. It will then replicate **cn=config**. You now have N-Way Multi-Provider on the config database.

We still have to replicate the actual data, not just the config, so  add to the provider (all active and configured consumers/providers will  pull down this config, as they are all syncing). Also, replace all *${*} variables with whatever is applicable to your setup:

```
     dn: olcDatabase={1}$BACKEND,cn=config
     objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
     objectClass: olc${BACKEND}Config
     olcDatabase: {1}$BACKEND
     olcSuffix: $BASEDN
     olcDbDirectory: ./db
     olcRootDN: $MANAGERDN
     olcRootPW: $PASSWD
     olcLimits: dn.exact="$MANAGERDN" time.soft=unlimited time.hard=unlimited
       size.soft=unlimited size.hard=unlimited
     olcSyncRepl: rid=004 provider=$URI1 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=005 provider=$URI2 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcSyncRepl: rid=006 provider=$URI3 binddn="$MANAGERDN" bindmethod=simple
       credentials=$PASSWD searchbase="$BASEDN" type=refreshOnly
       interval=00:00:00:10 retry="5 5 300 5" timeout=1
     olcMultiProvider: TRUE

     dn: olcOverlay=syncprov,olcDatabase={1}${BACKEND},cn=config
     changetype: add
     objectClass: olcOverlayConfig
     objectClass: olcSyncProvConfig
     olcOverlay: syncprov
```



------

**Note:** All of your servers' clocks must be tightly synchronized using e.g. NTP http://www.ntp.org/, atomic clock, or some other reliable time reference.

------





------

**Note:** As stated in *slapd-config*(5), URLs specified in *olcSyncRepl* directives are the URLs of the servers from which to replicate. These must exactly match the URLs *slapd* listens on (*-h* in [Command-Line Options](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/runningslapd.html#Command-Line Options)). Otherwise slapd may attempt to replicate from itself, causing a loop.

------





------

**Note:** The *entryCSN* and *contextCSN* attributes are used to track changes to an entry and naming context, respectively. The `SID` which must be unique for each replication provider is a component of these CSNs. If you're using *slapadd* to load a database and there are no entryCSNs already present in the input LDIF, *slapadd* will generate them with a *SID* of `000`. This is not a valid *SID* for multi-provider replication, and you should use the `-S` option of *slapadd* (8) to specify a valid *SID* for these generated CSNs. If there are existing entryCSNs in the input LDIF, *slapadd* will not change them.

------



### 18.3.4. Mirror mode

Mirror mode configuration is actually very easy. If you have ever  setup a normal slapd syncrepl provider, then the only change is the  following two directives:

```
       multiprovider  on
       serverID    1
```



------

**Note:** You need to make sure that the *serverID* of each provider node is different and add it as a global configuration option.

------



#### 18.3.4.1. Mirror Node Configuration

The first step is to configure the syncrepl provider the same as in the [Set up the provider slapd](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Set up the provider slapd) section.

Here's a specific cut down example using [LDAP Sync Replication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#LDAP Sync Replication) in *refreshAndPersist* mode:

Mirror mode node 1:

```
       # Global section
       serverID    1
       # database section

       # syncrepl directive
       syncrepl      rid=001
                     provider=ldap://ldap-sid2.example.com
                     bindmethod=simple
                     binddn="cn=mirrormode,dc=example,dc=com"
                     credentials=mirrormode
                     searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                     schemachecking=on
                     type=refreshAndPersist
                     retry="60 +"

       multiprovider on
```

Mirror mode node 2:

```
       # Global section
       serverID    2
       # database section

       # syncrepl directive
       syncrepl      rid=001
                     provider=ldap://ldap-sid1.example.com
                     bindmethod=simple
                     binddn="cn=mirrormode,dc=example,dc=com"
                     credentials=mirrormode
                     searchbase="dc=example,dc=com"
                     schemachecking=on
                     type=refreshAndPersist
                     retry="60 +"

       multiprovider on
```

It's simple really; each Mirror mode node is setup **exactly** the same, except that the *serverID* is unique, and each consumer is pointed to the other server.

##### 18.3.4.1.1. Failover Configuration

There are generally 2 choices for this; 1.  Hardware  proxies/load-balancing or dedicated proxy software, 2. using a Back-LDAP proxy as a syncrepl provider

A typical enterprise example might be:



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/dual_dc.png)



Figure X.Y: Mirror mode in a Dual Data Center Configuration

##### 18.3.4.1.2. Normal Consumer Configuration

This is exactly the same as the [Set up the consumer slapd](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#Set up the consumer slapd) section. It can either setup in normal syncrepl replication mode, or in delta-syncrepl replication mode.

#### 18.3.4.2. Mirror mode Summary

You will now have a directory architecture that provides all of the  consistency guarantees of single-provider replication, while also  providing the high availability of multi-provider replication.

### 18.3.5. Syncrepl Proxy

        database    monitor

        database    config

You can see we use the *updatedn* directive here and example ACLs (`usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.acl`) for this could be:

```
        # Give the replicator DN unlimited read access.  This ACL may need to be
        # merged with other ACL statements.

        access to *
             by dn.base="cn=replicator,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" write
             by * break

        access to dn.base=""
                by * read

        access to dn.base="cn=Subschema"
                by * read

        access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"
            by dn.exact="uid=admin,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" write
            by users read
            by * none

        access to *
                by self write
                by * read
```

In order to support more replicas, just add more *database ldap* sections and increment the *syncrepl rid* number accordingly.



------

**Note:** You must populate the Provider and Replica directories with the same data, unlike when using normal Syncrepl

------



If you do not have access to modify the provider directory  configuration you can configure a standalone ldap proxy, which might  look like:

                        retry="5 5 300 5"

        overlay         syncprov
```

As you can see, you can let your imagination go wild using Syncrepl and *slapd-ldap(8)* tailoring your replication to fit your specific network topology.

# 19. Maintenance

System Administration is all about maintenance, so it is only fair  that we discuss how to correctly maintain an OpenLDAP deployment.

------

## 19.1. Directory Backups

Backup strategies largely depend on the amount of change in the  database and how much of that change an administrator might be willing  to lose in a catastrophic failure. There are two basic methods that can  be used:

1. Backup the LMDB database itself

The LMDB database can be copied live using the mdb_copy command.  If  the database is a sparse file via the use of the "writemap" environment  flag, the resulting copy will be the actual size of the database rather  than a sparse copy.

2. Periodically run slapcat and back up the LDIF file:

Slapcat can be run while slapd is active. However, one runs the risk  of an inconsistent database- not from the point of slapd, but from the  point of the applications using LDAP. For example, if a provisioning  application performed tasks that consisted of several LDAP operations,  and the slapcat took place concurrently with those operations, then  there might be inconsistencies in the LDAP database from the point of  view of that provisioning application and applications that depended on  it. One must, therefore, be convinced something like that won't happen.  One way to do that would be to put the database in read-only mode while  performing the slapcat. The other disadvantage of this approach is that  the generated LDIF files can be rather large and the accumulation of the day's backups could add up to a substantial amount of space.

You can use *slapcat*(8) to generate an LDIF file for each of your *slapd*(8) back-mdb databases.

```
    slapcat -f slapd.conf -b "dc=example,dc=com"
```

For back-mdb this command may be ran while slapd(8) is running.

------

## 19.2. Checkpointing

Setting a checkpoint is only necessary when back-mdb has the dbnosync flag set. Otherwise it has no effect. With back-mdb the kbyte option is not implemented, meaning it will only run a checkpoint based on the  elapsed amount of minutes flag.

------

## 19.3. Migration

If upgrading, please consult [Upgrading from 2.5.x](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/appendix-upgrading.html) first to see if you need to make changes to your configuration as part of the upgrade.

After that, the simplest steps needed to migrate between versions or upgrade, depending on your deployment type are:

 

1. **Stop the current server when convenient** 
    
2. **slapcat the current data out** 
    
3. **Clear out the current data directory (/usr/local/var/openldap-data/)** 
    
4. **Perform the software upgrades** 
    
5. **Perform any configuration upgrades required** 
    
6. **slapadd the exported data back into the directory** 
    
7. **Start the server**

Obviously this doesn't cater for any complicated deployments with [N-Way Multi-Provider](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html#N-Way Multi-Provider), but following the above sections and using either commercial support or community support should help. Also check the [Troubleshooting](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/troubleshooting.html) section.

# 20. Monitoring

*slapd*(8) supports an optional LDAP monitoring interface you can use to obtain information regarding the current state of your *slapd* instance.  For instance, the interface allows you to determine how many clients are connected to the server currently. The monitoring  information is provided by a specialized backend, the *monitor* backend.  A manual page, *slapd-monitor*(5) is available.

When the monitoring interface is enabled, LDAP clients may be used to access information provided by the *monitor* backend, subject to access and other controls.

When enabled, the *monitor* backend dynamically generates and returns objects in response to search requests in the *cn=Monitor* subtree.  Each object contains information about a particular aspect of the server.  The information is held in a combination of user  applications and operational attributes.   This information can be  accessed with *ldapsearch(1)*, with any general-purpose LDAP browser, or with specialized monitoring tools.  The [Accessing Monitoring Information](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/monitoringslapd.html#Accessing Monitoring Information) section provides a brief tutorial on how to use *ldapsearch*(1) to access monitoring information, while the Monitor information section details monitoring information base and its organization.

While support for the monitor backend is included in default builds  of slapd(8), this support requires some configuration to become active.  This may be done using either `cn=config` or *slapd.conf*(5).  The former is discussed in the Monitor configuration via cn=config section of this of this chapter.  The latter is discussed in the [Monitor configuration via slapd.conf(5)](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/monitoringslapd.html#Monitor configuration via slapd.conf(5)) section of this chapter.  These sections assume monitor backend is built into *slapd* (e.g., `--enable-monitor=yes`, the default).  If the monitor backend was built as a module (e.g., `--enable-monitor=mod`, this module must loaded.  Loading of modules is discussed in the [Configuring slapd](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconf2.html) and [The slapd Configuration File](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html) chapters.

------

## 20.1. Monitor configuration via cn=config(5)

The *monitor backend* is statically built into slapd and can be instantiated via ldapadd.

```
 dn: olcDatabase=monitor,cn=config
 objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
 olcDatabase: monitor
```

------

## 20.2. Monitor configuration via slapd.conf(5)

Configuration of the slapd.conf(5) to support LDAP monitoring is quite simple.

First, ensure *core.schema* schema configuration file is included by your *slapd.conf*(5) file.  The *monitor* backend requires it.

Second, instantiate the *monitor backend* by adding a *database monitor* directive below your existing database sections.  For instance:

```
        database monitor
```

Lastly, add additional global or database directives as needed.

Like most other database backends, the monitor backend does honor  slapd(8) access and other administrative controls.   As some monitor  information may be sensitive, it is generally recommend access to  cn=monitor be restricted to directory administrators and their  monitoring agents.  Adding an *access* directive immediately below the *database monitor* directive is a clear and effective approach for controlling access.  For instance, the addition of the following *access* directive immediately below the *database monitor* directive restricts access to monitoring information to the specified directory manager.

```
        access to *
                by dn.exact="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com
                by * none
```

More information on *slapd*(8) access controls, see *The access Control Directive* section of the [The slapd Configuration File](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/slapdconfig.html) chapter and *slapd.access*(5).

After restarting *slapd*(8), you are ready to start exploring the monitoring information provided in `cn=config` as discussed in the [Accessing Monitoring Information](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/monitoringslapd.html#Accessing Monitoring Information) section of this chapter.

One can verify slapd(8) is properly configured to provide monitoring information by attempting to read the `cn=monitor` object. For instance, if the following *ldapsearch*(1) command returns the cn=monitor object (with, as requested, no attributes), it's working.

```
        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W \
                -b 'cn=Monitor' -s base 1.1
```

Note that unlike general purpose database backends, the database suffix is hardcoded.  It's always `cn=Monitor`.  So no *suffix* directive should be provided.  Also note that general purpose database  backends, the monitor backend cannot be instantiated multiple times.   That is, there can only be one (or zero) occurrences of `database monitor` in the server's configuration.

------

## 20.3. Accessing Monitoring Information

As previously discussed, when enabled, the *monitor* backend dynamically generates and returns objects in response to search requests in the *cn=Monitor* subtree.  Each object contains information about a particular aspect of the server.  The information is held in a combination of user  applications and operational attributes.  This information can be  accessed with *ldapsearch(1)*, with any general-purpose LDAP browser, or with specialized monitoring tools.

This section provides a provides a brief tutorial on how to use *ldapsearch*(1) to access monitoring information.

To inspect any particular monitor object, one performs search operation on the object with a baseObject scope and a `(objectClass=*)` filter.  As the monitoring information is contained in a combination of user applications and operational attributes, the return all user  applications attributes (e.g., `'*'`) and all operational attributes (e.g., `'+'`) should be requested.   For instance, to read the `cn=Monitor` object itself, the *ldapsearch*(1) command (modified to fit your configuration) can be used:

```
        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W \
                -b 'cn=Monitor' -s base '(objectClass=*)' '*' '+'
```

When run against your server, this should produce output similar to:

```
        dn: cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorServer
        structuralObjectClass: monitorServer
        cn: Monitor
        creatorsName:
        modifiersName:
        createTimestamp: 20061208223558Z
        modifyTimestamp: 20061208223558Z
        description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
        description: This object contains information about this server.
        description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
         must be explicitly requested.
        monitoredInfo: OpenLDAP: slapd 2.5 (Dec  7 2006 17:30:29)
        entryDN: cn=Monitor
        subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
        hasSubordinates: TRUE
```

To reduce the number of uninteresting attributes returned, one can be more selective when requesting which attributes are to be returned.   For instance, one could request the return of all attributes allowed by  the *monitorServer* object class (e.g., `@objectClass`) instead of all user and all operational attributes:

```
        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W \
                -b 'cn=Monitor' -s base '(objectClass=*)' '@monitorServer'
```

This limits the output as follows:

```
        dn: cn=Monitor
        objectClass: monitorServer
        cn: Monitor
        description: This subtree contains monitoring/managing objects.
        description: This object contains information about this server.
        description: Most of the information is held in operational attributes, which
         must be explicitly requested.
        monitoredInfo: OpenLDAP: slapd 2.X (Dec  7 2006 17:30:29)
```

To return the names of all the monitoring objects, one performs a search of `cn=Monitor` with subtree scope and `(objectClass=*)` filter and requesting no attributes (e.g., `1.1`) be returned.

```
        ldapsearch -x -D 'cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com' -W -b 'cn=Monitor' -s sub 1.1
```

If you run this command you will discover that there are many objects in the *cn=Monitor* subtree.  The following section describes some of the commonly available monitoring objects.

------

## 20.4. Monitor Information

The *monitor* backend provides a wealth of information useful  for monitoring the slapd(8) contained in set of monitor objects. Each  object contains information about a particular aspect of the server,  such as a backends, a connection, or a thread. Some objects serve as  containers for other objects and used to construct a hierarchy of  objects.

In this hierarchy, the most superior object is {cn=Monitor}. While  this object primarily serves as a container for other objects, most of  which are containers, this object provides information about this  server.  In particular, it provides the slapd(8) version string.   Example:

```
        dn: cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: OpenLDAP: slapd 2.X (Dec  7 2006 17:30:29)
```



------

**Note:** Examples in this section (and its subsections) have been trimmed to show only key information.

------



### 20.4.1. Backends

The `cn=Backends,cn=Monitor` object provides a list of  available backends.  The list of available backends includes all builtin backends, as well as those backends loaded by modules.  For example:

```
        dn: cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: config
        monitoredInfo: ldif
        monitoredInfo: monitor
        monitoredInfo: mdb
```

This indicates the *config*, *ldif*, *monitor*, and *mdb* backends are available.

The `cn=Backends,cn=Monitor` object is also a container for  available backend objects.  Each available backend object contains  information about a particular backend.  For example:

```
        dn: cn=Backend 0,cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: config
        monitorRuntimeConfig: TRUE
        supportedControl: 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2
        seeAlso: cn=Database 0,cn=Databases,cn=Monitor

        dn: cn=Backend 1,cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: ldif
        monitorRuntimeConfig: TRUE
        supportedControl: 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2

        dn: cn=Backend 2,cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: monitor
        monitorRuntimeConfig: TRUE
        supportedControl: 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2
        seeAlso: cn=Database 2,cn=Databases,cn=Monitor

        dn: cn=Backend 3,cn=Backends,cn=Monitor
        monitoredInfo: mdb
        monitorRuntimeConfig: TRUE
        supportedControl: 1.3.6.1.1.12
        supportedControl: 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2
        supportedControl: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.5.2
        supportedControl: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.319
        supportedControl: 1.3.6.1.1.13.1
        supportedControl: 1.3.6.1.1.13.2
        supportedControl: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.10.1
        supportedControl: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1413
        supportedControl: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.7.2
```

For each of these objects, monitorInfo indicates which backend the information in the object is about.  For instance, the `cn=Backend 5,cn=Backends,cn=Monitor` object contains (in the example) information about the *mdb* backend.

| **Attribute**    | **Description**                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| monitoredInfo    | Name of backend                               |
| supportedControl | supported LDAP control extensions             |
| seeAlso          | Database objects of instances of this backend |

### 20.4.2. Connections

The main entry is empty; it should contain some statistics on the number of connections.

Dynamic child entries are created for each open connection, with  stats on the activity on that connection (the format will be detailed  later). There are two special child entries that show the number of  total and current connections respectively.

For example:

Total Connections:

```
   dn: cn=Total,cn=Connections,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitorCounterObject
   monitorCounter: 4
   entryDN: cn=Total,cn=Connections,cn=Monitor
   subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
   hasSubordinates: FALSE
```

   hasSubordinates: FALSE
```

### 20.4.3. Databases

The main entry contains the naming context of each configured  database; the child entries contain, for each database, the type and the naming context.

For example:

```
   dn: cn=Database 2,cn=Databases,cn=Monitor
   structuralObjectClass: monitoredObject
   monitoredInfo: monitor
   monitorIsShadow: FALSE
   monitorContext: cn=Monitor
   readOnly: FALSE
   entryDN: cn=Database 2,cn=Databases,cn=Monitor
   subschemaSubentry: cn=Subschema
   hasSubordinates: FALSE
```

### 20.4.4. Listener

These values can be added, replaced or deleted; they affect what  messages are sent to the syslog device. Custom values could be added by  custom modules.

### 20.4.6. Operations

It shows some statistics on the operations performed by the server:

```
   Initiated

   Delete
   Modrdn
   Modify
   Compare
   Search
   Abandon
   Extended
```

There are too many types to list example here, so please try for yourself using Monitor search example

### 20.4.7. Overlays

The main entry contains the type of overlays available at run-time;  the child entries, for each overlay, contain the type of the overlay.

It should also contain the modules that have been loaded if dynamic overlays are enabled:

```
   # Overlays, Monitor
   dn: cn=Overlays,cn=Monitor

# 21. Load Balancing with lloadd

As covered in the [Replication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/replication.html) chapter, replication is a fundamental requirement for delivering a  resilient enterprise deployment.  As such there's a need for an LDAPv3  capable load balancer to spread the load between the various directory  instances.

*lloadd*(8) provides the capability to distribute LDAP v3 requests between a set of running *slapd* instances.  It can run as a standalone daemon *lloadd*, or as an embedded module running inside of *slapd*.

------

## 21.1. Overview

*lloadd*(8) was designed to handle LDAP loads. It is  protocol-aware and can balance LDAP loads on a per-operation basis  rather than on a per-connection basis.

*lloadd*(8) distributes the load across a set of slapd  instances. The client connects to the load balancer instance which  forwards the request to one of the servers and returns the response back to the client.

------

## 21.2. When to use the OpenLDAP load balancer

In general, the OpenLDAP load balancer spreads the load across  configured backend servers.  It does not perform so-called intelligent  routing. It does not understand semantics behind the operations being  performed by the clients.

More considerations:

- - Servers are indistinguishable with respect to data contents.  The exact same copy of data resides on every server.
  - The sequence of operations isn't important.  For example, read after update isn't required by the client.
  - If your client can handle both connection pooling and load distribution then it's preferable to lloadd.
  - Clients with different requirements (e.g. a coherent session  vs. simple but high traffic clients) are directed to separate lloadd  configurations.

------

## 21.3. Directing operations to backends

### 21.3.1. Default behaviour

In the simplest configuration several backends would be configured within a single roundrobin tier:

```
       feature proxyauthz

       bindconf bindmethod=simple
                binddn="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
                credentials=secret

       tier roundrobin
       backend-server uri=ldap://server1.example.com
                      numconns=5 bindconns=5
                      max-pending-ops=10 conn-max-pending=3
                      retry=5000
       backend-server uri=ldap://server2.example.com
                      numconns=5 bindconns=5
                      max-pending-ops=10 conn-max-pending=3
                      retry=5000
```

After startup *lloadd* will open 10 connections to each **ldap://server1.example.com** and **ldap://server2.example.com**, 5 for regular requests, where it will bind as **cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com**, and 5 dedicated to serving client Bind requests. If connection set up  fails, it will wait 5000ms (5 seconds) before making another attempt to  that server.

When a new Bind request comes from a client, it will be allocated to one of the available *bind connections*, each of which can only carry one request at a time. For other requests  that need to be passed on to the backends, backends are considered in  order:

- if the number of pending/in-flight for that backend is at or above 10, it is skipped
- the first appropriate upstream connection is chosen:
  - an idle *bind connection* for Bind requests
  - a *regular connection* with less than 3 pending operations for other types of requests
- if no such connection is available, the next backend in order is checked
- if we go through the whole list without choosing an upstream connection, we return a failure to the client, either an **LDAP_UNAVAILABLE** if no connections of the appropriate type have been established at all or **LDAP_BUSY** otherwise

When a connection is chosen, the operation is forwarded and  response(s) returned to the client. Should that connection go away  before the final response is received, the client is notified with a **LDAP_OTHER** failure code.

So long as *feature proxyauthz* is configured, every operation forwarded over a *regular connection* has the **PROXYAUTHZ** control ([RFC4370](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4370.txt)) prepended indicating the client's bound identity, unless that identity matches the *binddn* configured in *bindconf*.

If another tier is configured:

```
       tier roundrobin
       backend-server uri=ldap://fallback.example.com
                      numconns=5 bindconns=5
                      max-pending-ops=10 conn-max-pending=3
                      retry=5000
```

Backends in this tier will only be considered when *lloadd* would have returned **LDAP_UNAVAILABLE** in the above case.

### 21.3.2. Alternate selection strategies

For various reasons, the *roundrobin* tier is appropriate in  the majority of use cases as it is both very scalable in terms of its  implementation and how its self-limiting interacts with backends when  multiple *lloadd* instances are being used at the same time.

Two alternative selection strategies have been implemented:

- - *tier weighted* applies predefined weights to how often a backend is considered first
  - *tier bestof* measures the time to first response from  each backend, when a new operation needs to be forwarded, two backends  are selected at random and the backend with better response time is  considered first. If connections on neither backend can be used,  selection falls back to the regular strategy used by the roundrobin  backend

The *weighted* tier might be appropriate when servers have differing load capacity. Due to its reinforced self-limiting feedback, the *bestof* tier might be appropriate in large scale environments where each backend's capacity/latency fluctuates widely and rapidly.

### 21.3.3. Coherence

#### 21.3.3.1. Write coherence

In default configurations, every operation submitted by the client is either processed internally (e.g. StartTLS, Abandon, Unbind, ...) or is forwarded to a connection of lloadd's choosing, independent of any  other other operation submitted by the same client.

There are certain traffic patterns where such such freedom is  undesirable and some kind of coherency is required. This applies to  write traffic, controls like Paged Results or many extended operations.

Client's operations can be pinned to the same backend as the last write operation:

```
       write_coherence 5
```

In this case, client's requests will be passed over to the same  backend (not necessarily over the same upstream connection) from the  moment a write request is passed on till at least 5 seconds have elapsed since last write operation has finished.

```
       write_coherence -1
```

Here, there is no timeout and the moment a write request is passed on to a backend, the client's operations will forever be passed on to this backend.

In both cases above, this limitation is lifted the moment a Bind request is received from the client connection.

#### 21.3.3.2. Extended operations/controls

Many controls and Extended operations establish shared state on the session. While *lloadd* implements some of these (StartTLS being one example), it supports the  administrator in defining how to deal with those it does not implement  special handling for.

```
       restrict_exop 1.1 reject
       # TXN Exop
       restrict_exop 1.3.6.1.1.21.1 connection
       # Password Modify Exop
       restrict_exop 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.1 write

       # Paged Results Control
       restrict_control 1.2.840.113556.1.4.319 connection
       # Syncrepl
       restrict_control 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.9.1 reject
```

The above configuration uses the special invalid OID of *1.1* to instruct *lloadd* to reject any Extended operation it does not recognize, except for Password Modify operation which is treated according to *write_coherence* above and the LDAP transactions, where it forwards all subsequent  requests over to the same upstream connection. Similarly, once a Paged  results control is seen on an operation, subsequent request will stick  to the same upstream connection while LDAP Syncrepl requests will be  rejected outright.

With both *restrict_exop* and *restrict_control*, any such limitation is lifted when a new Bind request comes in as any client state is assumed to be reset.

When configuring these to anything else than *reject*, keep in mind that many extensions have not been designed or implemented with a multiplexing proxy like *lloadd* in mind and might open considerable operational and/or security concerns when allowed.

------

## 21.4. Runtime configurations

It deploys in one of two ways:

1. Standalone daemon: *lloadd* 
2. Loaded into the slapd daemon as a module: *lloadd.la* 

It is recommended to run with the balancer module embedded in slapd  because dynamic configuration (cn=config) and the monitor backend are  then available.

**Sample load balancer scenario:**



![img](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/load-balancer-scenario.png)



Figure: Load balancer sample scenario

1. The LDAP client submits an LDAP operation to the load balancer daemon.
2. The load balancer forwards the request to one of the backend instances in its pool of servers.
3. The backend slapd server processes the request and returns the response to the load balancer instance.
4. The load balancer returns the response to the client.  The  client's unaware that it's connecting to a load balancer instead of  slapd.

------

## 21.5. Build Notes

To build the load balancer from source, follow the instructions in the [A Quick-Start Guide](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/quickstart.html) substituting the following commands:

1. To configure as standalone daemon:
2. To configure as embedded module to slapd:

------

## 21.6. Sample Runtime

1. To run embedded as 

   lloadd 

    module:


   - the startup is the same as starting the *slapd*  daemon.

   - URLs is for slapd management. The load balancer's listener URLs set in the configuration file or node. (more later)

2. To run as standalone daemon:


   - Other than a different daemon name, running standalone has the same options as starting *slapd* .

   - -h URLs specify the lloadd's interface directly, there is no management interface.

For a complete list of options, checkout the man page *lloadd.8* 

------

## 21.7. Configuring load balancer

### 21.7.1. Common configuration options

Many of the same configuration options as slapd. For complete list, check the *lloadd*(5) man page.

 **Edit the slapd.conf or cn=config configuration file**.

To configure your working *lloadd*(8) you need to make the following changes to your configuration file:

1. include *core.schema*  (embedded only)
2. *TLSShareSlapdCTX { on | off }* 
3. Other common TLS slapd options
4. Setup argsfile/pidfile
5. Setup moduleload path (embedded mode only)
6. *moduleload      lloadd.la* 
7. loglevel, threads, ACL's
8. *backend lload*  begin lloadd specific backend configurations
9. *listen ldap://:PORT*  Specify listen port for load balancer
10. *feature proxyauthz*  Use the proxy authZ control to forward client's identity
11. *io-threads INT*  specify the number of threads to use  for the connection manager.  The default is 1 and this is typically  adequate for up to 16 CPU cores

### 21.7.2. Sample backend config

Sample setup config for load balancer running in front of four slapd instances.

```
backend lload

# The Load Balancer manages its own sockets, so they have to be separate
# from the ones slapd manages (as specified with the -h "URLS" option at
# startup).
listen ldap://:1389

# Enable authorization tracking
feature proxyauthz

# Specify the number of threads to use for the connection manager.  The default is 1 and this is typically adequate for up to 16 CPU cores.
# The value should be set to a power of 2:
io-threads  2

# If TLS is configured above, use the same context for the Load Balancer
# If using cn=config, this can be set to false and different settings
# can be used for the Load Balancer
TLSShareSlapdCTX true

# Authentication and other options (timeouts) shared between backends.
bindconf bindmethod=simple
         binddn=dc=example,dc=com credentials=secret
         network-timeout=5
         tls_cacert="/usr/local/etc/openldap/ca.crt"
         tls_cert="/usr/local/etc/openldap/host.crt"
         tls_key="/usr/local/etc/openldap/host.pem"


# List the backends we should relay operations to, they all have to be
# practically indistinguishable. Only TLS settings can be specified on
# a per-backend basis.

# 22. Tuning

This is perhaps one of the most important chapters in the guide, because if you have not tuned *slapd*(8) correctly or grasped how to design your directory and environment, you can expect very poor performance.

Reading, understanding and experimenting using the instructions and  information in the following sections, will enable you to fully  understand how to tailor your directory server to your specific  requirements.

It should be noted that the following information has been collected  over time from our community based FAQ. So obviously the benefit of this real world experience and advice should be of great value to the  reader.

------

## 22.1. Performance Factors

Various factors can play a part in how your directory performs on  your chosen hardware and environment. We will attempt to discuss these  here.

### 22.1.1. Memory

Scale your cache to use available memory and increase system memory if you can.

### 22.1.2. Disks

Use fast filesystems, and conduct your own testing to see which  filesystem types perform best with your workload. (On our own Linux  testing, EXT2 and JFS tend to provide better write performance than  everything else, including newer filesystems like EXT4, BTRFS, etc.)

Use fast subsystems. Put each database on separate disks.

### 22.1.3. Network Topology

------

## 22.2. Indexes

### 22.2.1. Understanding how a search works

If you're searching on a filter that has been indexed, then the  search reads the index and pulls exactly the entries that are referenced by the index. If the filter term has not been indexed, then the search  must read every single entry in the target scope and test to see if each entry matches the filter. Obviously indexing can save a lot of work  when it's used correctly.

In back-mdb, indexes can only track a certain number of entries per  key (by default that number is 2^16 = 65536). If more entries' values  hash to this key, some/all of them will have to be represented by a  range of candidates, making the index less useful over time as deletions cannot usually be tracked accurately.

### 22.2.2. What to index

As a general rule, to make any use of indexes, you must set up an equality index on objectClass:

```
        index objectClass eq
```

Then you should create indices to match the actual filter terms used in search queries.

```
        index cn,sn,givenname,mail eq
```

Each attribute index can be tuned further by selecting the set of  index types to generate. For example, substring and approximate search  for organizations (o) may make little sense (and isn't like done very  often). And searching for *userPassword* likely makes no sense what so ever.

General rule: don't go overboard with indexes. Unused indexes must be maintained and hence can only slow things down.

See *slapd.conf*(5) and *slapdindex*(8) for more information

### 22.2.3. Presence indexing

If your client application uses presence filters and if the target  attribute exists on the majority of entries in your target scope, then  all of those entries are going to be read anyway, because they are valid members of the result set. In a subtree where 100% of the entries are  going to contain the same attributes, the presence index does absolutely NOTHING to benefit the search, because 100% of the entries match that  presence filter. As an example, setting a presence index on objectClass  provides no benefit since it is present on every entry.

So the resource cost of generating the index is a complete waste of  CPU time, disk, and memory. Don't do it unless you know that it will be  used, and that the attribute in question occurs very infrequently in the target data.

Almost no applications use presence filters in their search queries.  Presence indexing is pointless when the target attribute exists on the  majority of entries in the database. In most LDAP deployments, presence  indexing should not be done, it's just wasted overhead.

See the *Logging* section below on what to watch out for if you have a frequently searched for attribute that is unindexed.

### 22.2.4. Equality indexing

Similarly to presence indexes, equality indexes are most useful if  the values searched for are uncommon. Most OpenLDAP indexes work by  hashing the normalised value and using the hash as the key. Hashing  behaviour depends on the matching rule syntax, some matching rules also  implement indexers that help speed up inequality (lower than, ...)  queries.

Check the documentation and other parts of this guide if some indexes are mandatory - e.g. to enable replication, it is expected you index  certain operational attributes, likewise if you rely on filters in ACL  processing.

Approximate indexes are usually identical to equality indexes unless a matching rule explicitly implements it. As of OpenLDAP 2.5, only  directoryStringApproxMatch and IA5StringApproxMatch matchers and  indexers are implemented, currently using soundex or metaphone, with  metaphone being the default.

### 22.2.5. Substring indexing

Substring indexes work on splitting the value into short chunks and  then indexing those in a similar way to how equality index does. The  storage space needed to store all of this data is analogous to the  amount of data being indexed, which makes the indexes extremely  heavy-handed in most scenarios.

------

## 22.3. Logging

### 22.3.1. What log level to use

The default of *loglevel stats* (256) is really the best bet.  There's a corollary to this when problems *do* arise, don't try to trace them using syslog. Use the debug flag instead, and capture slapd's  stderr output. syslog is too slow for debug tracing, and it's inherently lossy - it will throw away messages when it can't keep up. See *slapd.conf*(5) or *slapd-config*(5) for more information on how to configure the loglevel.

Contrary to popular belief, *loglevel 0* is not ideal for production as you won't be able to track when problems first arise.

### 22.3.2. What to watch out for

The most common message you'll see that you should pay attention to is:

```
       "<= mdb_equality_candidates: (foo) index_param failed (18)"
```

That means that some application tried to use an equality filter (*foo=<somevalue>*) and attribute *foo* does not have an equality index. If you see a lot of these messages,  you should add the index. If you see one every month or so, it may be  acceptable to ignore it.

The default syslog level is stats (256) which logs the basic  parameters of each request; it usually produces 1-3 lines of output. On  Solaris and systems that only provide synchronous syslog, you may want  to turn it off completely, but usually you want to leave it enabled so  that you'll be able to see index messages whenever they arise. On Linux  you can configure syslogd to run asynchronously, in which case the  performance hit for moderate syslog traffic pretty much disappears.

### 22.3.3. Improving throughput

You can improve logging performance on some systems by configuring syslog not to sync the file system with every write (*man syslogd/syslog.conf*). In Linux, you can prepend the log file name with a "-" in *syslog.conf*. For example, if you are using the default LOCAL4 logging you could try:

```
       # LDAP logs
       LOCAL4.*         -/var/log/ldap
```

For syslog-ng, add or modify the following line in *syslog-ng.conf*:

```
       options { sync(n); };
```

where n is the number of lines which will be buffered before a write.

------

## 22.4. *slapd*(8) Threads

*slapd*(8) can process requests via a configurable number of threads, which in turn affects the in/out rate of connections.

This value should generally be a function of the number of "real"  cores on the system, for example on a server with 2 CPUs with one core  each, set this to 8, or 4 threads per real core.  This is a "read"  maximized value. The more threads that are configured per core, the  slower *slapd*(8) responds for "read" operations.  On the flip  side, it appears to handle write operations faster in a heavy write/low  read scenario.

The upper bound for good read performance appears to be 16 threads (which also happens to be the default setting).

# 23. Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble using OpenLDAP, get onto the OpenLDAP-Software mailing list, or:

- Browse the list archives at http://www.openldap.org/lists/#archives
- Search the FAQ at http://www.openldap.org/faq/
- Search the Issue Tracking System at http://www.openldap.org/its/

Chances are the problem has been solved and explained in detail many times before.

## 23.1. User or Software errors?

More often than not, an error is caused by a configuration problem or a misunderstanding of what you are trying to implement and/or achieve.

We will now attempt to discuss common user errors.

------

## 23.2. Checklist

The following checklist can help track down your problem. Please try to use if **before** posting to the list, or in the rare circumstances of reporting a bug.

 

1. **Use the \*slaptest\* tool to verify configurations before starting \*slapd\*** 
    
2. **Verify that \*slapd\* is listening to the specified port(s) (389 and 636, generally) before trying the \*ldapsearch\*** 
    
3. **Can you issue an \*ldapsearch\*?**

## 23.3. OpenLDAP Bugs

Sometimes you may encounter an actual OpenLDAP bug, in which case please visit our Issue Tracking system http://www.openldap.org/its/ and report it. However, make sure it's not already a known bug or a common user problem.

- bugs in historic versions of OpenLDAP will not be considered;
- bugs in released versions that are no longer present in the Git master branch, either because they have been fixed or because they no  longer apply, will not be considered as well;
- bugs in distributions of OpenLDAP software that are not related to the software as provided by OpenLDAP will not be considered; in  those cases please refer to the distributor.



------

**Note:** Our Issue Tracking system is **NOT** for OpenLDAP **Support**, please join our mailing Lists: http://www.openldap.org/lists/ for that.

## 23.7. Debugging *slapd*(8)

After reading through the above sections and before e-mailing the  OpenLDAP lists, you might want to try out some of the following to track down the cause of your problems:

- A loglevel of stats (256) is generally a good first loglevel to use  for getting information useful to list members on issues. This is the  default loglevel if none is configured.
- Running *slapd -d -1* can often track down fairly simple issues, such as missing schemas and incorrect file permissions for the *slapd* user to things like certs
- Check your logs for errors, as discussed at http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/358.html

## 23.8. Commercial Support

The firms listed at http://www.openldap.org/support/ offer technical support services catering to OpenLDAP community.

The listing of any given firm should not be viewed as an endorsement  or recommendation of any kind, nor as otherwise indicating there exists a business relationship or an affiliation between any listed firm and the OpenLDAP Foundation or the OpenLDAP Project or its contributors.

# Upgrading from 2.5.x

The following sections attempt to document the steps you will need to take in order to upgrade from the latest 2.5.x OpenLDAP version.

The normal upgrade procedure, as discussed in the [Maintenance](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/maintenance.html) section, should of course still be followed prior to doing any of this.

------

## B.1. ppolicy overlay

The pwdCheckModule option has been moved to the overlay  configuration. Existing settings in password policy entries will be  ignored. It will be necessary to use pwdUseCheckModule instead and add  this configuration directive to the overlay when upgrading if it is  currently in use.

------

## B.2. lloadd backends

Backends for lloadd are now grouped in tiers specifying the balancing strategy. OpenLDAP 2.5 configurations must be updated to account for  this change.

------

## B.3. monitor backend

In 2.5 and prior, the managedInfo attribute in the cn=Log entry could be used to change the loglevel of the slapd process. In 2.6,  monitorLogLevel can be used to change the slapd log level and  monitorDebugLevel can be used to change the slapd debug level.

------

## B.4. contrib modules

If still using the lastbind overlay with olcLastBindPrecision (when  olcLastBindForwardUpdates is needed), you will need to configure  precision on its backend entry instead and the overlay will honour it.  The old attribute is no longer accepted or supported.

# C. Common errors encountered when using OpenLDAP Software

The following sections attempt to summarize the most common causes of LDAP errors when using OpenLDAP

------

## C.1. Common causes of LDAP errors

### C.1.1. ldap_*: Can't contact LDAP server

The **Can't contact LDAP server** error is usually returned when the LDAP server cannot be contacted. This may occur for many reasons:

- the LDAP server is not running; this can be checked by running, for example,

```
      telnet <host> <port>
```

replacing *<host>* and *<port>* with the hostname and the port the server is supposed to listen on.

- the client has not been instructed to contact a running server; with OpenLDAP command-line tools this is accomplished by providing the -H  switch, whose argument is a valid LDAP url corresponding to the  interface the server is supposed to be listening on.

### C.1.2. ldap_*: No such object

The **no such object** error is generally returned when the target DN of the operation cannot be located. This section details reasons  common to all operations. You should also look for answers specific to  the operation (as indicated in the error message).

The most common reason for this error is non-existence of the named object. First, check for typos.

Also note that, by default, a new directory server holds no objects  (except for a few system entries). So, if you are setting up a new  directory server and get this message, it may simply be that you have  yet to add the object you are trying to locate.

The error commonly occurs because a DN was not specified and a default was not properly configured.

If you have a suffix specified in slapd.conf eg.

```
      suffix "dc=example,dc=com"
```

You should use

```
      ldapsearch -b 'dc=example,dc=com' '(cn=jane*)'
```

to tell it where to start the search.

The `-b` should be specified for all LDAP commands unless you have an *ldap.conf*(5) default configured.

See *ldapsearch*(1), *ldapmodify*(1)

Also, *slapadd*(8) and its ancillary programs are very strict about the syntax of the LDIF file.

Some liberties in the LDIF file may result in an apparently  successful creation of the database, but accessing some parts of it may  be difficult.

One known common error in database creation is putting a blank line before the first entry in the LDIF file. **There must be no leading blank lines in the LDIF file.**

It is generally recommended that *ldapadd*(1) be used instead of *slapadd*(8) when adding new entries your directory. *slapadd*(8) should be used to bulk load entries known to be valid.

Another cause of this message is a referral ({SECT:Constructing a  Distributed Directory Service}}) entry to an unpopulated directory.

Either remove the referral, or add a single record with the referral base DN to the empty directory.

This error may also occur when slapd is unable to access the contents of its database because of file permission problems. For instance, on a Red Hat Linux system, slapd runs as user 'ldap'. When slapadd is run as root to create a database from scratch, the contents of `/var/lib/ldap` are created with user and group root and with permission 600, making the contents inaccessible to the slapd server.

### C.1.3. ldap_*: Can't chase referral

This is caused by the line

```
      referral        ldap://root.openldap.org
```

In `slapd.conf`, it was provided as an example for how to use  referrals in the original file. However if your machine is not  permanently connected to the Internet, it will fail to find the server,  and hence produce an error message.

To resolve, just place a # in front of line and restart slapd or point it to an available ldap server.

See also: *ldapadd*(1), *ldapmodify*(1) and *slapd.conf*(5)

### C.1.4. ldap_*: server is unwilling to perform

slapd will return an unwilling to perform error if the backend holding the target entry does not support the given operation.

The password backend is only willing to perform searches. It will return an unwilling to perform error for all other operations.

### C.1.5. ldap_*: Insufficient access

This error occurs when server denies the operation due to  insufficient access. This is usually caused by binding to a DN with  insufficient privileges (or binding anonymously) to perform the  operation.

You can bind as the rootdn/rootpw specified in *slapd.conf*(5) to gain full access. Otherwise, you must bind to an entry which has  been granted the appropriate rights through access controls.

### C.1.6. ldap_*: Invalid DN syntax

The target (or other) DN of the operation is invalid. This implies  that either the string representation of the DN is not in the required  form, one of the types in the attribute value assertions is not defined, or one of the values in the attribute value assertions does not conform to the appropriate syntax.

### C.1.7. ldap_*: Referral hop limit exceeded

This error generally occurs when the client chases a referral which  refers itself back to a server it already contacted. The server responds as it did before and the client loops. This loop is detected when the  hop limit is exceeded.

This is most often caused through misconfiguration of the server's default referral. The default referral should not be itself:

That is, on [ldap://myldap/](ldap://myldap/) the default referral should not be [ldap://myldap/](ldap://myldap/) (or any hostname/ip which is equivalent to myldap).

### C.1.8. ldap_*: operations error

In some versions of *slapd*(8), *operationsError* was returned instead of other.

### C.1.9. ldap_*: other error

The other result code indicates an internal error has occurred. While the additional information provided with the result code might provide  some hint as to the problem, often one will need to consult the server's log files.

### C.1.10. ldap_add/modify: Invalid syntax

This error is reported when a value of an attribute does not conform  to syntax restrictions. Additional information is commonly provided  stating which value of which attribute was found to be invalid. Double  check this value and other values (the server will only report the first error it finds).

Common causes include:

- extraneous whitespace (especially trailing whitespace)
- improperly encoded characters (LDAPv3 uses UTF-8 encoded Unicode)
- empty values (few syntaxes allow empty values)

For certain syntax, like OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID), this error can  indicate that the OID descriptor (a "short name") provided is  unrecognized. For instance, this error is returned if the *objectClass* value provided is unrecognized.

### C.1.11. ldap_add/modify: Object class violation

This error is returned with the entry to be added or the entry as  modified violates the object class schema rules. Normally additional  information is returned the error detailing the violation. Some of these are detailed below.

Violations related to the entry's attributes:

```
      Attribute not allowed
```

A provided attribute is not allowed by the entry's object class(es).

```
      Missing required attribute
```

An attribute required by the entry's object class(es) was not provided.

Violations related to the entry's class(es):

```
      Entry has no objectClass attribute
```

The entry did not state which object classes it belonged to.

```
      Unrecognized objectClass
```

One (or more) of the listed objectClass values is not recognized.

```
      No structural object class provided
```

None of the listed objectClass values is structural.

```
      Invalid structural object class chain
```

Two or more structural objectClass values are not in same structural object class chain.

```
      Structural object class modification
```

Modify operation attempts to change the structural class of the entry.

```
      Instantiation of abstract objectClass.
```

An abstract class is not subordinate to any listed structural or auxiliary class.

```
      Invalid structural object class
```

Other structural object class problem.

```
      No structuralObjectClass operational attribute
```

This is commonly returned when a shadow server is provided an entry  which does not contain the structuralObjectClass operational attribute.

Note that the above error messages as well as the above answer assumes basic knowledge of LDAP/X.500 schema.

### C.1.12. ldap_add: No such object

The "ldap_add: No such object" error is commonly returned if parent  of the entry being added does not exist. Add the parent entry first...

For example, if you are adding "cn=bob,dc=domain,dc=com" and you get:

```
      ldap_add: No such object
```

The entry "dc=domain,dc=com" likely doesn't exist. You can use ldapsearch to see if does exist:

```
      ldapsearch -b 'dc=domain,dc=com' -s base '(objectclass=*)'
```

If it doesn't, add it. See [A Quick-Start Guide](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/quickstart.html) for assistance.



------

**Note:** if the entry being added is the same as database  suffix, it's parent isn't required. i.e.: if your suffix is  "dc=domain,dc=com", "dc=com" doesn't need to exist to add  "dc=domain,dc=com".

------



This error will also occur if you try to add any entry that the server is not configured to hold.

For example, if your database suffix is "dc=domain,dc=com" and you  attempt to add "dc=domain2,dc=com", "dc=com", "dc=domain,dc=org",  "o=domain,c=us", or an other DN in the "dc=domain,dc=com" subtree, the  server will return a "No such object" (or referral) error.

*slapd*(8) will generally return "no global superior  knowledge" as additional information indicating its return noSuchObject  instead of a referral as the server is not configured with knowledge of a global superior server.

### C.1.13. ldap add: invalid structural object class chain

This particular error refers to the rule about STRUCTURAL  objectclasses, which states that an object is of one STRUCTURAL class,  the structural class of the object. The object is said to belong to this class, zero or more auxiliaries classes, and their super classes.

While all of these classes are commonly listed in the objectClass  attribute of the entry, one of these classes is the structural object  class of the entry. Thus, it is OK for an objectClass attribute to  contain inetOrgPerson, organizationalPerson, and person because they  inherit one from another to form a single super class chain. That is,  inetOrgPerson SUPs organizationPerson SUPs person. On the other hand, it is invalid for both inetOrgPerson and account to be listed in  objectClass as inetOrgPerson and account are not part of the same super  class chain (unless some other class is also listed with is a subclass  of both).

To resolve this problem, one must determine which class will better  serve structural object class for the entry, adding this class to the  objectClass attribute (if not already present), and remove any other  structural class from the entry's objectClass attribute which is not a  super class of the structural object class.

Which object class is better depends on the particulars of the  situation. One generally should consult the documentation for the  applications one is using for help in making the determination.

### C.1.14. ldap_add: no structuralObjectClass operational attribute

ldapadd(1) may error:

```
      adding new entry "uid=XXX,ou=People,o=campus,c=ru"
        ldap_add: Internal (implementation specific) error (80)
           additional info: no structuralObjectClass operational attribute
```

when slapd(8) cannot determine, based upon the contents of the  objectClass attribute, what the structural class of the object should  be.

### C.1.15. ldap_add/modify/rename: Naming violation

OpenLDAP's slapd checks for naming attributes and distinguished values consistency, according to RFC 4512.

Naming attributes are those attributeTypes that appear in an entry's  RDN; distinguished values are the values of the naming attributes that  appear in an entry's RDN, e.g, in

```
      cn=Someone+mail=someone@example.com,dc=example,dc=com
```

the naming attributes are cn and mail, and the distinguished values are Someone and someone@example.com.

OpenLDAP's slapd checks for consistency when:

- adding an entry
- modifying an entry, if the values of the naming attributes are changed
- renaming an entry, if the RDN of the entry changes

Possible causes of error are:

- the naming attributes are not present in the entry; for example:

```
                dn: dc=example,dc=com
                objectClass: organization
                o: Example
                # note: "dc: example" is missing
```

- the naming attributes are present in the entry, but in the attributeType definition they are marked as:
  - collective
  - operational
  - obsolete
- the naming attributes are present in the entry, but the distinguished values are not; for example:

```
                dn: dc=example,dc=com
                objectClass: domain
                dc: foobar
                # note: "dc" is present, but the value is not "example"
```

- the naming attributes are present in the entry, with the distinguished values, but the naming attributes:
  - do not have an equality field, so equality cannot be asserted
  - the matching rule is not supported (yet)
  - the matching rule is not appropriate
- the given distinguished values do not comply with their syntax
- other errors occurred during the validation/normalization/match process; this is a catchall: look at previous logs for details in case  none of the above apply to your case.

In any case, make sure that the attributeType definition for the  naming attributes contains an appropriate EQUALITY field; or that of the superior, if they are defined based on a superior attributeType (look  at the SUP field). See RFC 4512 for details.

### C.1.16. ldap_add/delete/modify/rename: no global superior knowledge

If the target entry name places is not within any of the databases  the server is configured to hold and the server has no knowledge of a  global superior, the server will indicate it is unwilling to perform the operation and provide the text "no global superior knowledge" as  additional text.

Likely the entry name is incorrect, or the server is not properly  configured to hold the named entry, or, in distributed directory  environments, a default referral was not configured.

### C.1.17. ldap_bind: Insufficient access

Current versions of slapd(8) requires that clients have  authentication permission to attribute types used for authentication  purposes before accessing them to perform the bind operation. As all  bind operations are done anonymously (regardless of previous bind  success), the auth access must be granted to anonymous.

In the example ACL below grants the following access:

- to anonymous users:
  - permission to authenticate using values of userPassword
- to authenticated users:
  - permission to update (but not read) their userPassword
  - permission to read any object excepting values of userPassword

All other access is denied.

```
        access to attr=userPassword
          by self =w
          by anonymous auth
        access *
          by self write
          by users read
```

### C.1.18. ldap_bind: Invalid credentials

The error usually occurs when the credentials (password) provided  does not match the userPassword held in entry you are binding to.

The error can also occur when the bind DN specified is not known to the server.

Check both! In addition to the cases mentioned above you should check if the server denied access to userPassword on selected parts of the  directory. In fact, slapd always returns "Invalid credentials" in case  of failed bind, regardless of the failure reason, since other return  codes could reveal the validity of the user's name.

To debug access rules defined in slapd.conf, add "ACL" to log level.

### C.1.19. ldap_bind: Protocol error

There error is generally occurs when the LDAP version requested by the client is not supported by the server.

The OpenLDAP Software 2.x server, by default, only accepts version 3  LDAP Bind requests but can be configured to accept a version 2 LDAP Bind request.



------

**Note:** The 2.x server expects LDAPv3 [RFC4510] to be  used when the client requests version 3 and expects a limited LDAPv3  variant (basically, LDAPv3 syntax and semantics in an LDAPv2 PDUs) to be used when version 2 is expected.

------



This variant is also sometimes referred to as LDAPv2+, but differs from the U-Mich LDAP variant in a number of ways.

### C.1.20. ldap_modify: cannot modify object class

This message is commonly returned when attempting to modify the  objectClass attribute in a manner inconsistent with the LDAP/X.500  information model. In particular, it commonly occurs when one tries to  change the structure of the object from one class to another, for  instance, trying to change an 'apple' into a 'pear' or a 'fruit' into a  'pear'.

Such changes are disallowed by the slapd(8) in accordance with LDAP and X.500 restrictions.

### C.1.21. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: ...

If you intended to bind using a DN and password and get an error from ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s, you likely forgot to provide a '-x'  option to the command. By default, SASL authentication is used. '-x' is  necessary to select "simple" authentication.

### C.1.22. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: No such Object

This indicates that LDAP SASL authentication function could not read  the Root DSE. The error will occur when the server doesn't provide a  root DSE. This may be due to access controls.

### C.1.23. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: No such attribute

This indicates that LDAP SASL authentication function could read the  Root DSE but it contained no supportedSASLMechanism attribute.

The supportedSASLmechanism attribute lists mechanisms currently  available. The list may be empty because none of the supported  mechanisms are currently available. For example, EXTERNAL is listed only if the client has established its identity by authenticating at a lower level (e.g. TLS).



------

**Note:** the attribute may not be visible due to access controls

------





------

**Note:** SASL bind is the default for all OpenLDAP tools,  e.g. ldapsearch(1), ldapmodify(1). To force use of "simple" bind, use  the "-x" option. Use of "simple" bind is not recommended unless one has  adequate confidentiality protection in place (e.g. TLS/SSL, IPSEC).

------



### C.1.24. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Unknown authentication method

This indicates that none of the SASL authentication supported by the  server are supported by the client, or that they are too weak or  otherwise inappropriate for use by the client. Note that the default  security options disallows the use of certain mechanisms such as  ANONYMOUS and PLAIN (without TLS).



------

**Note:** SASL bind is the default for all OpenLDAP tools.  To force use of "simple" bind, use the "-x" option. Use of "simple" bind is not recommended unless one has adequate confidentiality protection  in place (e.g. TLS/SSL, IPSEC).

------



### C.1.25. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error (82)

Apparently not having forward and reverse DNS entries for the LDAP server can result in this error.

### C.1.26. ldap_search: Partial results and referral received

This error is returned with the server responses to an LDAPv2 search  query with both results (zero or more matched entries) and references  (referrals to other servers). See also: ldapsearch(1).

If the updatedn on the replica does not exist, a referral will be returned. It may do this as well if the ACL needs tweaking.

### C.1.27. ldap_start_tls: Operations error

ldapsearch(1) and other tools will return

```
        ldap_start_tls: Operations error (1)
              additional info: TLS already started
```

When the user (though command line options and/or ldap.conf(5)) has  requested TLS (SSL) be started twice. For instance, when specifying both "-H ldaps://server.do.main" and "-ZZ".

------

## C.2. Other Errors

### C.2.1. ber_get_next on fd X failed errno=34 (Numerical result out of range)

This slapd error generally indicates that the client sent a message  that exceeded an administrative limit. See sockbuf_max_incoming and  sockbuf_max_incoming_auth configuration directives in slapd.conf(5).

### C.2.2. ber_get_next on fd X failed errno=11 (Resource temporarily unavailable)

This message is not indicative of abnormal behavior or error. It  simply means that expected data is not yet available from the resource,  in this context, a network socket. slapd(8) will process the data once  it does becomes available.

### C.2.3. daemon: socket() failed errno=97 (Address family not supported)

This message indicates that the operating system does not support one of the (protocol) address families which slapd(8) was configured to  support. Most commonly, this occurs when slapd(8) was configured to  support IPv6 yet the operating system kernel wasn't. In such cases, the  message can be ignored.

### C.2.4. GSSAPI: gss_acquire_cred: Miscellaneous failure; Permission denied;

This message means that slapd is not running as root and, thus, it  cannot get its Kerberos 5 key from the keytab, usually file  /etc/krb5.keytab.

A keytab file is used to store keys that are to be used by services  or daemons that are started at boot time. It is very important that  these secrets are kept beyond reach of intruders.

That's why the default keytab file is owned by root and protected  from being read by others. Do not mess with these permissions, build a  different keytab file for slapd instead, and make sure it is owned by  the user that slapd runs as.

To do this, start kadmin, and enter the following commands:

```
     addprinc -randkey ldap/ldap.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
     ktadd -k /etc/openldap/ldap.keytab ldap/ldap.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
```

Then, on the shell, do:

```
     chown ldap:ldap /etc/openldap/ldap.keytab
     chmod 600 /etc/openldap/ldap.keytab
```

Now you have to tell slapd (well, actually tell the gssapi library in Kerberos 5 that is invoked by Cyrus SASL) where to find the new keytab. You do this by setting the environment variable KRB5_KTNAME like this:

```
     export KRB5_KTNAME="FILE:/etc/openldap/ldap.keytab"
```

Set that environment variable on the slapd start script (Red Hat users might find /etc/sysconfig/ldap a perfect place).

This only works if you are using MIT kerberos. It doesn't work with Heimdal, for instance.

In Heimdal there is a function gsskrb5_register_acceptor_identity()  that sets the path of the keytab file you want to use. In Cyrus SASL 2  you can add

```
    keytab: /path/to/file
```

to your application's SASL config file to use this feature. This only works with Heimdal.

### C.2.5. access from unknown denied

This related to TCP wrappers. See hosts_access(5) for more  information. in the log file: "access from unknown denied" This related  to TCP wrappers. See hosts_access(5) for more information. for example:  add the line "slapd: .hosts.you.want.to.allow" in /etc/hosts.allow to  get rid of the error.

### C.2.6. ldap_read: want=# error=Resource temporarily unavailable

This message occurs normally. It means that pending data is not yet  available from the resource, a network socket. slapd(8) will process the data once it becomes available.

### C.2.7. `make test' fails

Some times, `make test' fails at the very first test with an obscure message like

```
    make test
    make[1]: Entering directory `/ldap_files/openldap-2.5.0/tests'
    make[2]: Entering directory `/ldap_files/openldap-2.5.0/tests'

    make: *** [test] Error 2
```

or so. Usually, the five lines

Waiting 5 seconds for slapd to start...

indicate that slapd didn't start at all.

In tests/testrun/slapd.1.log there is a full log of what slapd wrote  while trying to start. The log level can be increased by setting the  environment variable SLAPD_DEBUG to the corresponding value; see  loglevel in slapd.conf(5) for the meaning of log levels.

A typical reason for this behavior is a runtime link problem, i.e.  slapd cannot find some dynamic libraries it was linked against. Try  running ldd(1) on slapd (for those architectures that support runtime  linking).

There might well be other reasons; the contents of the log file should help clarifying them.

Tests that fire up multiple instances of slapd typically log to  tests/testrun/slapd.<n>.log, with a distinct <n> for each  instance of slapd; list tests/testrun/ for possible values of <n>.

### C.2.8. ldap_*: Internal (implementation specific) error (80) - additional info: entry index delete failed

This seems to be related with wrong ownership of the MDB's dir  (/var/lib/ldap) and files. The files must be owned by the user that  slapd runs as.

```
    chown -R ldap:ldap /var/lib/ldap
```

fixes it in Debian

### C.2.9. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1)

Using SASL, when a client contacts LDAP server, the slapd service dies immediately and client gets an error :

```
     SASL/GSSAPI authentication started ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1)
```

Then check the slapd service, it stopped.

# LDAP Result Codes

For the purposes of this guide, we have incorporated the standard LDAP result codes from *Appendix A.  LDAP Result Codes* of [RFC4511](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt), a copy of which can be found in `doc/rfc` of the OpenLDAP source code.

We have expanded the description of each error in relation to the  OpenLDAP toolsets. LDAP extensions may introduce extension-specific  result codes, which are not part of RFC4511. OpenLDAP returns the result codes related to extensions it implements. Their meaning is documented  in the extension they are related to.

------

## H.1. Non-Error Result Codes

These result codes (called "non-error" result codes) do not indicate an error condition:

```
        success (0),
        compareFalse (5),
        compareTrue (6),
        referral (10), and
        saslBindInProgress (14).
```

The *success*, *compareTrue*, and *compareFalse* result codes indicate successful completion (and, hence, are referred to as "successful" result codes).

The *referral* and *saslBindInProgress* result codes indicate the client needs to take additional action to complete the operation.

------

## H.2. Result Codes

Existing LDAP result codes are described as follows:

------

## H.3. success (0)

Indicates the successful completion of an operation.



------

**Note:** this code is not used with the Compare operation.  See [compareFalse (5)](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/appendix-ldap-result-codes.html#compareFalse (5)) and [compareTrue (6)](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/appendix-ldap-result-codes.html#compareTrue (6)).

------



------

## H.4. operationsError (1)

Indicates that the operation is not properly sequenced with relation to other operations (of same or different type).

For example, this code is returned if the client attempts to StartTLS ([RFC4511](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt) Section 4.14) while there are other uncompleted operations or if a TLS layer was already installed.

------

## H.5. protocolError (2)

Indicates the server received data that is not well-formed.

For Bind operation only, this code is also used to indicate that the server does not support the requested protocol version.

For Extended operations only, this code is also used to indicate that the server does not support (by design or configuration) the Extended  operation associated with the *requestName*.

For request operations specifying multiple controls, this may be used to indicate that the server cannot ignore the order of the controls as  specified, or that the combination of the specified controls is invalid  or unspecified.

------

## H.6. timeLimitExceeded (3)

Indicates that the time limit specified by the client was exceeded before the operation could be completed.

------

## H.7. sizeLimitExceeded (4)

Indicates that the size limit specified by the client was exceeded before the operation could be completed.

------

## H.8. compareFalse (5)

Indicates that the Compare operation has successfully completed and the assertion has evaluated to FALSE or Undefined.

------

## H.9. compareTrue (6)

Indicates that the Compare operation has successfully completed and the assertion has evaluated to TRUE.

------

## H.10. authMethodNotSupported (7)

Indicates that the authentication method or mechanism is not supported.

------

## H.11. strongerAuthRequired (8)

Indicates the server requires strong(er) authentication in order to complete the operation.

When used with the Notice of Disconnection operation, this code  indicates that the server has detected that an established security  association between the client and server has unexpectedly failed or  been compromised.

------

## H.12. referral (10)

Indicates that a referral needs to be chased to complete the operation (see [RFC4511](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt) Section 4.1.10).

------

## H.13. adminLimitExceeded (11)

Indicates that an administrative limit has been exceeded.

------

## H.14. unavailableCriticalExtension (12)

Indicates a critical control is unrecognized (see [RFC4511](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt) Section 4.1.11).

------

## H.15. confidentialityRequired (13)

Indicates that data confidentiality protections are required.

------

## H.16. saslBindInProgress (14)

Indicates the server requires the client to send a new bind request,  with the same SASL mechanism, to continue the authentication process  (see [RFC4511](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt) Section 4.2).

------

## H.17. noSuchAttribute (16)

Indicates that the named entry does not contain the specified attribute or attribute value.

------

## H.18. undefinedAttributeType (17)

Indicates that a request field contains an unrecognized attribute description.

------

## H.19. inappropriateMatching (18)

Indicates that an attempt was made (e.g., in an assertion) to use a matching rule not defined for the attribute type concerned.

------

## H.20. constraintViolation (19)

Indicates that the client supplied an attribute value that does not conform to the constraints placed upon it by the data model.

For example, this code is returned when multiple values are supplied to an attribute that has a SINGLE-VALUE constraint.

------

## H.21. attributeOrValueExists (20)

Indicates that the client supplied an attribute or value to be added to an entry, but the attribute or value already exists.

------

## H.22. invalidAttributeSyntax (21)

Indicates that a purported attribute value does not conform to the syntax of the attribute.

------

## H.23. noSuchObject (32)

Indicates that the object does not exist in the DIT.

------

## H.24. aliasProblem (33)

Indicates that an alias problem has occurred.  For example, the code  may used to indicate an alias has been dereferenced that names no  object.

------

## H.25. invalidDNSyntax (34)

Indicates that an LDAPDN or RelativeLDAPDN field (e.g., search base,  target entry, ModifyDN newrdn, etc.) of a request does not conform to  the required syntax or contains attribute values that do not conform to  the syntax of the attribute's type.

------

## H.26. aliasDereferencingProblem (36)

Indicates that a problem occurred while dereferencing an alias.   Typically, an alias was encountered in a situation where it was not  allowed or where access was denied.

------

## H.27. inappropriateAuthentication (48)

Indicates the server requires the client that had attempted to bind  anonymously or without supplying credentials to provide some form of  credentials.

------

## H.28. invalidCredentials (49)

Indicates that the provided credentials (e.g., the user's name and password) are invalid.

------

## H.29. insufficientAccessRights (50)

Indicates that the client does not have sufficient access rights to perform the operation.

------

## H.30. busy (51)

Indicates that the server is too busy to service the operation.

------

## H.31. unavailable (52)

Indicates that the server is shutting down or a subsystem necessary to complete the operation is offline.

------

## H.32. unwillingToPerform (53)

Indicates that the server is unwilling to perform the operation.

------

## H.33. loopDetect (54)

Indicates that the server has detected an internal loop (e.g., while dereferencing aliases or chaining an operation).

------

## H.34. namingViolation (64)

Indicates that the entry's name violates naming restrictions.

------

## H.35. objectClassViolation (65)

Indicates that the entry violates object class restrictions.

------

## H.36. notAllowedOnNonLeaf (66)

Indicates that the operation is inappropriately acting upon a non-leaf entry.

------

## H.37. notAllowedOnRDN (67)

Indicates that the operation is inappropriately attempting to remove a value that forms the entry's relative distinguished name.

------

## H.38. entryAlreadyExists (68)

Indicates that the request cannot be fulfilled (added, moved, or renamed) as the target entry already exists.

------

## H.39. objectClassModsProhibited (69)

Indicates that an attempt to modify the object class(es) of an entry's 'objectClass' attribute is prohibited.

For example, this code is returned when a client attempts to modify the structural object class of an entry.

------

## H.40. affectsMultipleDSAs (71)

Indicates that the operation cannot be performed as it would affect multiple servers (DSAs).

------

## H.41. other (80)

# Generic configure Instructions

```
Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
