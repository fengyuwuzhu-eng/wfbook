# Failure modes 故障模式

Kinds of failures and etcd’s tolerance for them
故障的种类和 etcd 对它们的容忍度



Failures are common in a large deployment of machines. A machine fails when its  hardware or software malfunctions. Multiple machines fail together when  there are power failures or network issues. Multiple kinds of failures  can also happen at once; it is almost impossible to enumerate all  possible failure cases.
故障在大型计算机部署中很常见。当计算机的硬件或软件出现故障时，计算机将发生故障。当出现电源故障或网络问题时，多台计算机会同时发生故障。多种故障也可能同时发生;几乎不可能列举所有可能的故障情况。

In this section, we catalog kinds of failures and discuss how etcd is  designed to tolerate these failures. Most users, if not all, can map a  particular failure into one kind of failure. To prepare for rare or [unrecoverable failures](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/recovery/), always [back up](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/maintenance/#snapshot-backup) the etcd cluster.
在本节中，我们将对故障类型进行分类，并讨论 etcd 如何设计以容忍这些故障。大多数用户（如果不是全部）可以将特定故障映射到一种故障。要为罕见或不可恢复的故障做好准备，请始终备份 etcd 集群。

## Minor followers failure 次要追随者失败

When fewer than half of the followers fail, the etcd cluster can still  accept requests and make progress without any major disruption. For  example, two follower failures will not affect a five member etcd  cluster’s operation. However, clients will lose connectivity to the  failed members. Client libraries should hide these interruptions from  users for read requests by automatically reconnecting to other members.  Operators should expect the system load on the other members to increase due to the reconnections.
当不到一半的追随者失败时，etcd 集群仍然可以接受请求并取得进展，而不会出现任何重大中断。例如，两个从属器故障不会影响五个成员的 etcd  集群的运行。但是，客户端将失去与失败成员的连接。客户端库应通过自动重新连接到其他成员来隐藏用户对读取请求的这些中断。操作员应该预期其他成员的系统负载会因重新连接而增加。

## Leader failure 领导者失败

When a leader fails, the etcd cluster automatically elects a new leader. The election does not happen instantly once the leader fails. It takes  about an election timeout to elect a new leader since the failure  detection model is timeout based.
当 leader 失败时，etcd 集群会自动选出新的 leader。一旦领导人失败，选举不会立即发生。由于故障检测模型是基于超时的，因此选举新领导者大约需要选举超时。

During the leader election the cluster cannot process any writes. Write  requests sent during the election are queued for processing until a new  leader is elected.
在领导者选举期间，集群无法处理任何写入操作。在选举期间发送的写入请求将排队等待处理，直到选出新的领导人。

Writes already sent to the old leader but not yet committed may be lost. The  new leader has the power to rewrite any uncommitted entries from the  previous leader. From the user perspective, some write requests might  time out after a new leader election. However, no committed writes are  ever lost.
已发送给旧领导但尚未提交的写入可能会丢失。新领导者有权重写前任领导者的任何未提交条目。从用户的角度来看，某些写入请求可能会在新的领导者选举后超时。但是，任何提交的写入都不会丢失。

The new leader extends timeouts automatically for all leases. This  mechanism ensures a lease will not expire before the granted TTL even if it was granted by the old leader.
新领导会自动延长所有租约的超时时间。此机制可确保租约不会在授予的 TTL 之前过期，即使它是由旧领导者授予的。

## Majority failure 多数失败

When the majority members of the cluster fail, the etcd cluster fails and cannot accept more writes.
当集群的大多数成员发生故障时，etcd 集群将失败，并且无法接受更多写入。

The etcd cluster can only recover from a majority failure once the majority of members become available. If a majority of members cannot come back  online, then the operator must start [disaster recovery](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/recovery/) to recover the cluster.
etcd 集群只有在大多数成员可用后才能从多数故障中恢复。如果大多数成员无法重新联机，则操作员必须启动灾难恢复才能恢复集群。

Once a majority of members works, the etcd cluster elects a new leader  automatically and returns to a healthy state. The new leader extends  timeouts automatically for all leases. This mechanism ensures no lease  expires due to server side unavailability.
一旦大多数成员工作，etcd 集群会自动选出一个新的领导者并返回健康状态。新领导会自动延长所有租约的超时时间。此机制可确保租约不会因服务器端不可用而过期。

## Network partition 网络分区

A network partition is similar to a minor followers failure or a leader  failure. A network partition divides the etcd cluster into two parts;  one with a member majority and the other with a member minority. The  majority side becomes the available cluster and the minority side is  unavailable. There is no “split-brain” in etcd because cluster members  are explicitly added/removed with each such change is approved by the  current majority of members.
网络分区类似于次要跟随者故障或领导者故障。网络分区将 etcd 集群分为两部分;一个是成员多数，另一个是成员少数。多数端成为可用的集群，少数端不可用。etcd 中没有“裂脑”，因为集群成员是明确添加/删除的，每次这样的更改都会得到当前大多数成员的批准。

If the leader is on the majority side, then from the majority point of  view the failure is a minority follower failure. If the leader is on the minority side, then it is a leader failure. The leader on the minority  side steps down and the majority side elects a new leader.
如果领导者站在多数派一边，那么从多数派的角度来看，失败就是少数追随者的失败。如果领导者站在少数派一边，那么这就是领导者的失败。少数派领导人下台，多数派选出新领导人。

Once the network partition clears, the minority side automatically  recognizes the leader from the majority side and recovers its state.
一旦网络分区被清除，少数方会自动识别多数方的领导者并恢复其状态。

## Failure during bootstrapping 引导期间失败

A cluster bootstrap is only successful if all required members  successfully start. If any failure happens during bootstrapping, remove  the data directories on all members and re-bootstrap the cluster with a  new cluster-token or new discovery token.
只有当所有必需的成员都成功启动时，集群引导程序才会成功。如果在引导过程中发生任何故障，请删除所有成员上的数据目录，并使用新的群集令牌或新的发现令牌重新引导群集。

Of course, it is possible to recover a failed bootstrapped cluster like  recovering a running cluster. However, it almost always takes more time  and resources to recover that cluster than bootstrapping a new one,  since there is no data to recover.
当然，可以恢复失败的引导集群，就像恢复正在运行的集群一样。但是，恢复该集群几乎总是比引导新集群需要更多的时间和资源，因为没有要恢复的数据。
