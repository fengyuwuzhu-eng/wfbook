## 需求

### Hardware

DNS hardware requirements have traditionally been quite modest. DNS 硬件需求传统上相当温和。对于许多安装，已退出现役的服务器作为 DNS 服务器的性能令人满意。

However, the DNSSEC features of BIND 9 may be quite CPU-intensive, so organizations that make heavy use of these features may wish to consider larger systems for these applications.然而，BIND 9的DNSSEC功能可能非常CPU密集，因此大量使用这些功能的组织可能希望考虑为这些应用程序使用更大的系统。BIND 9 is fully multithreaded, allowing full utilization of multiprocessor systems for installations that need it.BIND9是完全多线程的，允许在需要它的安装中充分利用多处理器系统。

#### CPU

CPU requirements for BIND 9 range from i386-class machines, for serving static zones without caching, to enterprise-class machines to process many dynamic updates and DNSSEC-signed zones, serving many thousands of queries per second.

BIND9的CPU需求范围从i386类机器（用于提供无缓存的静态区域）到企业级机器（用于处理许多动态更新）和DNSSEC签名区域（每秒提供数千个查询）。

#### Memory

Server memory must be sufficient to hold both the cache and the zones loaded from disk. The [`max-cache-size`](https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#namedconf-statement-max-cache-size) option can limit the amount of memory used by the cache, at the expense of reducing cache hit rates and causing more DNS traffic. It is still good practice to have enough memory to load all zone and cache data into memory; unfortunately, the best way to determine this for a given installation is to watch the name server in operation. After a few weeks, the server process should reach a relatively stable size where entries are expiring from the cache as fast as they are being inserted.

服务器内存必须足以容纳缓存和从磁盘加载的区域。最大缓存大小选项可以限制缓存使用的内存量，代价是降低缓存命中率并导致更多DNS流量。有足够的内存将所有区域和缓存数据加载到内存中仍然是一个好的做法；不幸的是，对于给定的安装，确定这一点的最佳方法是监视名称服务器的运行。几周后，服务器进程应该达到一个相对稳定的大小，即条目从缓存中过期的速度与插入的速度一样快。

#### Name Server-Intensive Environment Issues名称服务器密集型环境问题

For name server-intensive environments, there are two configurations that may be used. The first is one where clients and any second-level internal name servers query the main name server, which has enough memory to build a large cache; this approach minimizes the bandwidth used by external name lookups. The second alternative is to set up second-level internal name servers to make queries independently. In this configuration, none of the individual machines need to have as much memory or CPU power as in the first alternative, but this has the disadvantage of making many more external queries, as none of the name servers share their cached data.

对于名称服务器密集型环境，可以使用两种配置。第一种是客户端和任何第二级内部名称服务器查询主名称服务器，该服务器有足够的内存来构建大型缓存；这种方法最小化了外部名称查找所使用的带宽。第二种选择是设置第二级内部名称服务器以独立进行查询。在这种配置中，没有一台单独的计算机需要像第一种配置中那样多的内存或CPU，但这有一个缺点，那就是产生更多的外部查询，因为没有一台名称服务器共享它们的缓存数据。

### 支持的平台

The current support status of BIND 9 versions across various platforms can be found in the ISC Knowledgebase:

https://kb.isc.org/docs/supported-platforms

In general, this version of BIND will build and run on any POSIX-compliant system with a C11-compliant C compiler, BSD-style sockets with RFC-compliant IPv6 support, POSIX-compliant threads, and the [required libraries](https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter10.html#build-dependencies).

The following C11 features are used in BIND 9:

- Atomic operations support, either in the form of C11 atomics or **__atomic** builtin operations.
- Thread Local Storage support, either in the form of C11 **_Thread_local**/**thread_local**, or the **__thread** GCC extension.

The C11 variants are preferred.

ISC regularly tests BIND on many operating systems and architectures, but lacks the resources to test all of them. Consequently, ISC is only able to offer support on a “best-effort” basis for some.

各种平台上BIND 9版本的当前支持状态可在ISC知识库中找到：

https://kb.isc.org/docs/supported-platforms

一般来说，此版本的BIND将在任何符合POSIX的系统上构建和运行，该系统具有符合C11的C编译器、具有符合RFC的IPv6支持的BSD风格套接字、符合POSIX标准的线程和所需的库。

BIND 9中使用了以下C11功能：

原子操作支持，以C11原子或原子内置操作的形式。

线程本地存储支持，可以是C11线程本地/线程本地，也可以是线程GCC扩展。

优选C11变体。

ISC定期在许多操作系统和体系结构上测试BIND，但缺乏测试所有这些的资源。因此，ISC只能在“尽最大努力”的基础上为某些人提供支持。

#### Regularly Tested Platforms定期测试平台

As of August 2022, current versions of BIND 9 are fully supported and regularly tested on the following systems:截至2022年8月，BIND 9的当前版本在以下系统上得到全面支持和定期测试：

- Debian 11
- Ubuntu LTS 20.04, 22.04
- Fedora 37
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS / Oracle Linux 7, 8, 9
- FreeBSD 12.3, 13.1
- OpenBSD 7.2
- Alpine Linux 3.16

The amd64, i386, armhf, and arm64 CPU architectures are all fully supported.

amd64、i386、armhf和arm64 CPU体系结构均完全受支持。

#### Best-Effort

The following are platforms on which BIND is known to build and run. ISC makes every effort to fix bugs on these platforms, but may be unable to do so quickly due to lack of hardware, less familiarity on the part of engineering staff, and other constraints. None of these are tested regularly by ISC.

以下是已知BIND可以在其上构建和运行的平台。ISC尽一切努力修复这些平台上的错误，但由于缺乏硬件、工程人员不太熟悉以及其他限制，可能无法快速修复。ISC没有定期测试这些。

- macOS 10.12+
- Solaris 11
- NetBSD
- Other Linux distributions still supported by their vendors, such as:
  - Ubuntu 20.10+
  - Gentoo
  - Arch Linux
- OpenWRT/LEDE 17.01+
- Other CPU architectures (mips, mipsel, sparc, …)

#### 社区维护

These systems may not all have the required dependencies for building BIND easily available, although it is possible in many cases to compile those directly from source. The community and interested parties may wish to help with maintenance, and we welcome patch contributions, although we cannot guarantee that we will accept them. All contributions will be assessed against the risk of adverse effect on officially supported platforms.尽管在许多情况下可以直接从源代码编译这些系统，但这些系统可能并不都具有构建BIND所需的依赖性。社区和相关方可能希望帮助维护，我们欢迎补丁贡献，尽管我们不能保证我们会接受它们。所有捐款都将根据对官方支持的平台产生不利影响的风险进行评估。

- Platforms past or close to their respective EOL dates, such as:
  - Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 18.04 (Ubuntu ESM releases are not supported)
  - CentOS 6
  - Debian 8 Jessie, 9 Stretch, 10 Buster
  - FreeBSD 10.x, 11.x

### 不支持的平台

These are platforms on which current versions of BIND 9 are known *not* to build or run:以下是已知BIND 9当前版本无法构建或运行的平台：

- Platforms without at least OpenSSL 1.0.2
- Windows
- Solaris 10 and older
- Platforms that do not support IPv6 Advanced Socket API (RFC 3542)
- Platforms that do not support atomic operations (via compiler or library)
- Linux without NPTL (Native POSIX Thread Library)
- Platforms on which **libuv >= 1.34** cannot be compiled or is not available

## 安装 BIND 9

```bash
# CentOS
yum install bind bind-utils
dnf install bind bind-utils
#如果要在 change-root 环境中运行 BIND，安装 bind-chroot 软件包。
yum install bind-chroot
dnf install bind-chroot

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install bind9
```

请注意，在 SELinux 处于 `enforcing` 模式（默认设置）的主机上运行 BIND 更为安全。 		

用于测试和解决 DNS 问题的有用软件包是软件 `dnsutils` 包。通常，这些工具已经安装完毕，但要检查和/或安装 `dnsutils` ，请输入以下内容：

```bash
# CentOS
yum install bind-utils
dnf install bind-utils

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install dnsutils
```

## BIND 9 Operating System Support

When a new branch of BIND 9 is released, ISC normally tests it to  ensure compatibility with the current versions of major operating  systems (OSes) at that time. In general, that branch of BIND 9 will  support those major operating systems until either that version of BIND 9 or that version of the OS reaches end-of-life (EOL) status.

The table below lists the operating systems supported by the current versions of BIND 9.

Legend:
 💚 Supported
 🔵 Best effort
 🟧 Community-maintained
 ❌ Unsupported or does not work

More information on the meaning of each of these legend symbols can be found later in this article.

For BIND 9 branch end-of-life dates, see [this article](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00896).

### Explanation of Legend Symbols

#### 💚 Supported

These platforms are regularly tested in our continuous integration  (CI) system. In general, this means using the AMD64 and ARM64 CPU  architectures.

#### 🔵 Best effort

These are platforms on which BIND is known to build and run. ISC  makes every effort to fix bugs on these platforms, but may be unable to  do so quickly due to lack of hardware, less familiarity on the part of  engineering staff, and other constraints. These may or may not be  regularly tested in our CI.

This also includes all the "other" CPU architectures (armhf, i386, MIPS, MIPSel, SPARC, etc.).

#### 🟧 Community-maintained

These systems are not officially supported or maintained by ISC. They may not have all the required dependencies for building BIND easily  available, although it will be possible in many cases to compile those  directly from source. The community and interested parties may wish to  help with maintenance, and we welcome patch contributions, although we  cannot guarantee that we will accept them. All contributions will be  assessed against the risk of adverse effect on officially supported  platforms.

**This includes all platforms past or close to their respective EOL dates.**

#### ❌ Unsupported platforms

These are platforms on which BIND is known *not* to build or run:

- Platforms without at least OpenSSL 1.0.2
- Windows Server 2012 and older
- Platforms that don't support IPv6 Advanced Socket API (RFC 3542)
- Platforms that don't support atomic operations (via compiler or library)
- Linux without Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL)
- Platforms on which `libuv` cannot be compiled

### Notes About Specific Platform Support

#### Debian Long Term Support (LTS) Releases

Any Debian version is officially supported with security updates  until one year after the next stable version is released. After the end  of official support, the Debian version becomes Debian LTS and is  maintained by the LTS team.

Compiling and running already-released BIND 9 versions on Debian LTS  versions is not officially supported by ISC, but any regressions in BIND 9 ESV on Debian LTS will be fixed (although with low priority).

New BIND 9 versions will support the latest Debian release, but they  may be incompatible with previous Debian releases, especially when the  official Debian security support period ends before the BIND 9 version's EOL. However, ISC will not knowingly break compatibility unless  justified by other requirements.

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Releases

The RHEL lifecycle is comprised of **Full Support**, **Maintenance Support 1**, and **Maintenance Support 2**.

BIND 9 Extended Support Versions (ESVs) will support an RHEL release until the end of **Maintenance Support 2** for the already-released version of RHEL, or the BIND 9 version's EOL, whichever comes first.

New BIND 9 versions will support the latest RHEL release, but they  may be incompatible with previous RHEL releases, especially when the **Full Support** period ends before the BIND 9 version's EOL. However, ISC will not  knowingly break compatibility unless justified by other requirements.

#### Ubuntu Interim Releases

At only nine months, Ubuntu interim release lifetimes are too short for any guarantees of support from the BIND 9 team.

#### Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) Releases

The Ubuntu LTS release cycle includes **Hardware and maintenance updates**, **Maintenance updates**, and **Extended Security Maintenance (ESM)**.

BIND 9 ESVs will support an Ubuntu release until the end of the **Maintenance updates** period for the already-released version of Ubuntu, or the BIND 9 version's EOL, whichever comes first.

Compiling and running already-released BIND 9 versions on Ubuntu ESM  versions is not officially supported by ISC, but any regressions in BIND 9 ESV on Ubuntu ESM will be fixed (although with low priority).

New BIND 9 versions will support the latest Ubuntu LTS release, but  they may be incompatible with previous Ubuntu LTS releases, especially  when the **Maintenance updates** period ends before the  BIND 9 version's EOL. However, ISC will not knowingly break  compatibility unless justified by other requirements.

## BIND 9's Operating System Requirements

In general, BIND will build and run on any POSIX-compliant system  with a C11-compliant C compiler, BSD-style sockets with RFC-compliant  IPv6 support, POSIX-compliant threads, the OpenSSL cryptography library, and for 9.17 and later versions, the `nghttp2` HTTP/2 library and the `libuv` asynchronous I/O library,

The following C11 features are used in BIND 9:

- Atomic operations support from the compiler is needed, either in the form of builtin operations, C11 atomics, or the `Interlocked` family of functions on Windows.
- Thread Local Storage support from the compiler is needed, either in the form of C11 `_Thread_local`/`thread_local`, the `__thread` GCC extension, or the `__declspec(thread)` MSVC extension on Windows.

BIND 9.17 requires a fairly recent version of `libuv` (at least 1.x). For some of the older systems, an updated `libuv` package will have to be installed from sources such as EPEL, PPA, or  other native sources for updated packages. The other option is to build  and install `libuv` from source.
