# Rsyslog
Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. It offers high-performance, great security features and a modular design. While it started as a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a kind of swiss army knife of logging, being able to   accept inputs from a wide variety of sources,
    transform them,
    and output the results to diverse destinations.

Rsyslog has a strong enterprise focus but also scales down to small systems. It supports, among others, MySQL , PostgreSQL, failover log destinations, syslog/tcp transport, fine grain output format control, high precision timestamps, queued operations and the ability to filter on any message part.
