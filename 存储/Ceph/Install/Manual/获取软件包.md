# 获取软件包

[TOC]

## 方式

- **Cephadm**

  可以基于发布名称或特定 Ceph 版本配置 Ceph 存储库。群集中的每个 Ceph 节点都必须具有internet 访问权限。

- **Configure Repositories Manually**

  手动配置包管理工具以检索 Ceph 包和所有启用的软件。群集中的每个 Ceph 节点都必须具有 internet 访问权限。

- **Download Packages Manually**

  如果环境不允许 Ceph 节点访问 internet ，手动下载软件包是安装 Ceph 的一种方便方法。

## cephadm

1. 下载 cephadm 脚本:

   ```bash
   curl --remote-name --location https://github.com/ceph/ceph/raw/pacific/src/cephadm/cephadm
   chmod +x cephadm
   ```

2. 基于发布名称配置Ceph存储库:

   ```bash
   ./cephadm add-repo --release pacific
   ```

   对于Octopus（15.2.0）及更高版本，还可以指定特定版本：:

   ```bash
   ./cephadm add-repo --version 15.2.1
   ```

   对于开发包，可以指定特定的分支名称：:

   ```bash
   ./cephadm add-repo --dev my-branch
   ```

3. 安装相应的软件包。直接使用包管理工具（例如 APT、Yum）安装，也可以使用 cephadm 。

   ```bash
   ./cephadm install ceph-common
   ```

## 配置 Repositories

- **Keys: (Recommended)** 

  无论是手动添加存储库还是下载软件包，都应该下载密钥来验证软件包。如果没有获得密钥，可能会遇到安全警告。

- **Ceph: (Required)**

- **Ceph Development: (Optional)**

  If you are developing for Ceph, testing Ceph development builds, or if you want features from the bleeding edge of Ceph development.如果您正在为 Ceph 开发、测试 Ceph 开发构建，或者想要来自 Ceph 开发前沿的功能，您可能会获得 Ceph 开发包。

### Add Keys

Add a key to your system’s list of trusted keys to avoid a security warning. For major releases (e.g., `luminous`, `mimic`, `nautilus`) and development releases (`release-name-rc1`, `release-name-rc2`), use the `release.asc` key.

#### APT

```bash
wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -
```

#### RPM

```bash
sudo rpm --import 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc'
```

### Ceph Release Packages

发布存储库使用 release.asc 密钥来验证包。要使用 Advanced Package Tool (APT) 或 Yellowdog Updater (YUM) 安装 Ceph 包，必须添加 Ceph 存储库。

可以在以下位置找到发行版：

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
https://download.ceph.com/debian-{release-name}
# CentOS/RHEL
https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{release-name}
```

 packages:对于 Octopus 及更高版本，还可以为特定版本 x.y.z 配置存储库。

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
https://download.ceph.com/debian-{version}
# RPM
https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{version}
```

#### Debian Packages

 call `lsb_release -sc` on the command line to get the short codename, and replace `{codename}` in the following command.将 Ceph 包存储库添加到系统的 APT 源列表中。对于较新版本的 Debian/Ubuntu，在命令行上调用 `lsb_release -sc` 以获取短代号，并在以下命令中替换 `{codename}` 。

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-pacific/ {codename} main'
```

对于之前的 Linux 发行版：

```bash
echo deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-pacific/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
```

For earlier Ceph releases, replace `{release-name}` with the name  with the name of the Ceph release. You may call `lsb_release -sc` on the command  line to get the short codename, and replace `{codename}` in the following command.

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-{release-name}/ {codename} main'
```

For older Linux distributions, replace `{release-name}` with the name of the release

```bash
echo deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-{release-name}/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
```

For development release packages, add our package repository to your system’s list of APT sources. 

```bash
echo deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-testing/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
```

#### RPM Packages

##### RHEL

For major releases, you may add a Ceph entry to the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory. Create a `ceph.repo` file. In the example below, replace `{ceph-release}` with  a major release of Ceph (e.g., `|stable-release|`) and `{distro}` with your Linux distribution (e.g., `el8`, etc.).  You may view https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/ directory to see which distributions Ceph supports. Some Ceph packages (e.g., EPEL) must take priority over standard packages, so you must ensure that you set `priority=2`.

```ini
[ceph]
name=Ceph packages for $basearch
baseurl=https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/$basearch
enabled=1
priority=2
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc

[ceph-noarch]
name=Ceph noarch packages
baseurl=https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/noarch
enabled=1
priority=2
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc

[ceph-source]
name=Ceph source packages
baseurl=https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{ceph-release}/{distro}/SRPMS
enabled=0
priority=2
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc
```

For specific packages, you may retrieve them by downloading the release package by name. Our development process generates a new release of Ceph every 3-4 weeks. These packages are faster-moving than the major releases.  Development packages have new features integrated quickly, while still undergoing several weeks of QA prior to release.

The repository package installs the repository details on your local system for use with `yum`. Replace `{distro}` with your Linux distribution, and `{release}` with the specific release of Ceph

```bash
su -c 'rpm -Uvh https://download.ceph.com/rpms/{distro}/x86_64/ceph-{release}.el7.noarch.rpm'
```

You can download the RPMs directly from

```http
https://download.ceph.com/rpm-testing
```

##### openSUSE Leap 15.1

You need to add the Ceph package repository to your list of zypper sources. This can be done with the following command

```bash
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems:/ceph/openSUSE_Leap_15.1/filesystems:ceph.repo
```

##### openSUSE Tumbleweed

The newest major release of Ceph is already available through the normal Tumbleweed repositories. There’s no need to add another package repository manually.

### Ceph Development Packages

If you are developing Ceph and need to deploy and test specific Ceph branches, ensure that you remove repository entries for major releases first.

#### DEB Packages

We automatically build Ubuntu packages for current development branches in the Ceph source code repository.  These packages are intended for developers and QA only.

Add the package repository to your system’s list of APT sources, but replace `{BRANCH}` with the branch you’d like to use (e.g., wip-hack, master).  

```bash
curl -L https://shaman.ceph.com/api/repos/ceph/{BRANCH}/latest/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -sc)/repo/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shaman.list
```

> **Note:**
>
> If the repository is not ready an HTTP 504 will be returned

The use of `latest` in the url, means it will figure out which is the last commit that has been built. Alternatively, a specific sha1 can be specified. For Ubuntu Xenial and the master branch of Ceph, it would look like

```bash
curl -L https://shaman.ceph.com/api/repos/ceph/master/53e772a45fdf2d211c0c383106a66e1feedec8fd/ubuntu/xenial/repo/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shaman.list
```

> **Warning:**
>
> Development repositories are no longer available after two weeks.

#### RPM Packages

For current development branches, you may add a Ceph entry to the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory. The [the shaman page](https://shaman.ceph.com) can be used to retrieve the full details of a repo file. It can be retrieved via an HTTP request, for example

```bash
curl -L https://shaman.ceph.com/api/repos/ceph/{BRANCH}/latest/centos/7/repo/ | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/shaman.repo
```

The use of `latest` in the url, means it will figure out which is the last commit that has been built. Alternatively, a specific sha1 can be specified. For CentOS 7 and the master branch of Ceph :

```bash
curl -L https://shaman.ceph.com/api/repos/ceph/master/53e772a45fdf2d211c0c383106a66e1feedec8fd/centos/7/repo/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/shaman.list
```

> **Warning:**
>
> Development repositories are no longer available after two weeks.



> **Note:**
>
> If the repository is not ready an HTTP 504 will be returned

## Download Packages Manually

If you are attempting to install behind a firewall in an environment without internet access, you must retrieve the packages (mirrored with all the necessary dependencies) before attempting an install.

### Debian Packages

The repository package installs the repository details on your local system for use with `apt`. Replace `{release}` with the latest Ceph release. Replace `{version}` with the latest Ceph version number. Replace `{distro}` with your Linux distribution codename. Replace `{arch}` with the CPU architecture.

```bash
wget -q https://download.ceph.com/debian-{release}/pool/main/c/ceph/ceph_{version}{distro}_{arch}.deb
```

### RPM Packages

Ceph requires additional third party libraries. To add the EPEL repository, execute the following

```bash
sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

Packages are currently built for the RHEL/CentOS8 (`el8`) platforms.  The repository package installs the repository details on your local system for use with `yum`. Replace `{distro}` with your distribution.

```bash
su -c 'rpm -Uvh https://download.ceph.com/rpm-octopus/{distro}/noarch/ceph-{version}.{distro}.noarch.rpm'
```

For example, for CentOS 8  (`el8`)

```bash
su -c 'rpm -Uvh https://download.ceph.com/rpm-octopus/el8/noarch/ceph-release-1-0.el8.noarch.rpm'
```

You can download the RPMs directly from

```bash
https://download.ceph.com/rpm-pacific
```

For earlier Ceph releases, replace `{release-name}` with the name with the name of the Ceph release. You may call `lsb_release -sc` on the command line to get the short codename.

```bash
su -c 'rpm -Uvh https://download.ceph.com/rpm-{release-name}/{distro}/noarch/ceph-{version}.{distro}.noarch.rpm'
```

## Cloning the Ceph Source Code Repository

You may clone a Ceph branch of the Ceph source code by going to [github Ceph Repository](https://github.com/ceph/ceph),  selecting a branch (`master` by default), and clicking the **Download ZIP** button.

To clone the Ceph source code repository, execute:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceph/ceph.git
```

Once `git clone` executes, you should have a full copy of the Ceph repository.

Tip

Make sure you maintain the latest copies of the submodules included in the repository. Running `git status` will tell you if the submodules are out of date.

```bash
cd ceph
git status
```

If your submodules are out of date, run:

```bash
git submodule update --force --init --recursive
```

### Choose a Branch

Once you clone the source code and submodules, your Ceph repository will be on the `master` branch by default, which is the unstable development branch. You may choose other branches too.

- `master`: The unstable development branch.
- `stable`: The bugfix branch.
- `next`: The release candidate branch.

```bash
git checkout master
```

## Build Ceph

You can get Ceph software by retrieving Ceph source code and building it yourself. To build Ceph, you need to set up a development environment, compile Ceph, and then either install in user space or build packages and install the packages.

### Build Prerequisites

Tip

Check this section to see if there are specific prerequisites for your Linux/Unix distribution.

A debug build of Ceph may take around 40 gigabytes. If you want to build Ceph in a virtual machine (VM) please make sure total disk space on the VM is at least 60 gigabytes.

Please also be aware that some distributions of Linux, like CentOS, use Linux Volume Manager (LVM) for the default installation. LVM may reserve a large portion of disk space of a typical sized virtual disk for the operating system.

Before you can build Ceph source code, you need to install several libraries and tools:

```bash
./install-deps.sh
```

Note

Some distributions that support Google’s memory profiler tool may use a different package name (e.g., `libgoogle-perftools4`).

### Build Ceph

Ceph is built using cmake. To build Ceph, navigate to your cloned Ceph repository and execute the following:

```bash
cd ceph
./do_cmake.sh
cd build
ninja
```

See [Installing a Build](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/install/install-storage-cluster#installing-a-build) to install a build in user space and [Ceph README.md](https://github.com/ceph/ceph#building-ceph) doc for more details on build.

### Build Ceph Packages

To build packages, you must clone the [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/install/clone-source) repository. You can create installation packages from the latest code using `dpkg-buildpackage` for Debian/Ubuntu or `rpmbuild` for the RPM Package Manager.

Tip

When building on a multi-core CPU, use the `-j` and the number of cores * 2. For example, use `-j4` for a dual-core processor to accelerate the build.

### Advanced Package Tool (APT)

To create `.deb` packages for Debian/Ubuntu, ensure that you have cloned the [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/install/clone-source) repository, installed the [Build Prerequisites](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/install/build-ceph/#build-prerequisites) and installed `debhelper`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install debhelper
```

Once you have installed debhelper, you can build the packages:

```bash
sudo dpkg-buildpackage
```

For multi-processor CPUs use the `-j` option to accelerate the build.

### RPM Package Manager

To create `.rpm` packages, ensure that you have cloned the [Ceph](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/install/clone-source) repository, installed the [Build Prerequisites](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/install/build-ceph/#build-prerequisites) and installed `rpm-build` and `rpmdevtools`:

```bash
yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools
```

Once you have installed the tools, setup an RPM compilation environment:

```bash
rpmdev-setuptree
```

Fetch the source tarball for the RPM compilation environment:

```bash
wget -P ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ https://download.ceph.com/tarballs/ceph-<version>.tar.bz2
```

Or from the EU mirror:

```bash
wget -P ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ http://eu.ceph.com/tarballs/ceph-<version>.tar.bz2
```

Extract the specfile:

```bash
tar --strip-components=1 -C ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/ --no-anchored -xvjf ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ceph-<version>.tar.bz2 "ceph.spec"
```

Build the RPM packages:

```bash
rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/ceph.spec
```

For multi-processor CPUs use the `-j` option to accelerate the build.              

## Ceph Mirrors

Change this to:

- http://eu.ceph.com/tarballs/
- http://eu.ceph.com/debian-hammer/
- http://eu.ceph.com/rpm-hammer/

### Mirroring

You can easily mirror Ceph yourself using a Bash script and rsync. A easy to use script can be found at [Github](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/master/mirroring).

When mirroring Ceph, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Choose a mirror close to you
- Do not sync in a interval shorter than 3 hours
- Avoid syncing at minute 0 of the hour, use something between 0 and 59

### Becoming a mirror

If you want to provide a public mirror for other users of Ceph you can opt to become a official mirror.

To make sure all mirrors meet the same standards some requirements have been set for all mirrors. These can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/master/mirroring).

If you want to apply for an official mirror, please contact the ceph-users mailinglist.

## Ceph Container Images

Important

Using the `:latest` tag is discouraged. If you use the `:latest` tag, there is no guarantee that the same image will be on each of your hosts.  Under these conditions, upgrades might not work properly. Remember that `:latest` is a relative tag, and a moving target.

Instead of the `:latest` tag, use explicit tags or image IDs. For example:

```bash
podman pull ceph/ceph:v15.2.0
```

### Official Releases

Ceph Container images are available from Docker Hub at:

```http
https://hub.docker.com/r/ceph
```

We automatically build container images for development `wip-*` branches in the ceph-ci.git repositories and push them to Quay at:

```http
https://quay.io/organization/ceph-ci
```

#### ceph-ci/ceph

- This is analogous to the ceph/ceph image above
- TODO: remove the `wip-*` limitation and also build ceph.git branches.
