# 升级 Ceph

[TOC]

自动升级过程遵循Ceph的最佳实践。例如:

* 升级顺序从MGR、MON开始，然后是其他守护进程。
* Each daemon is restarted only after Ceph indicates that the cluster will remain available.只有在Ceph表示集群仍然可用后，才会重启每个守护进程。

Ceph集群健康状态很可能在升级期间切换到HEALTH_WARNING。

Cephadm is capable of safely upgrading Ceph from one bugfix release to another.  For example, you can upgrade from v15.2.0 (the first Octopus release) to the next point release v15.2.1.

The automated upgrade process follows Ceph best practices.  For example:

- The upgrade order starts with managers, monitors, then other daemons.
- Each daemon is restarted only after Ceph indicates that the cluster will remain available.

Keep in mind that the Ceph cluster health status is likely to switch to HEALTH_WARNING during the upgrade.

## 开始升级

开始前，需要确认所有主机都在线，且集群状态是 healthy 。

```bash
ceph -s
```

To upgrade (or downgrade) to a specific release:

```bash
ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version <version>

ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version 15.2.1
```

## 监控升级

确定是否正在进行升级，以及集群正在升级到哪个版本:

```bash
ceph orch upgrade status
```

在进行升级时，将在ceph状态输出中看到一个进度条。例如:

```bash
ceph -s

[...]
  progress:
    Upgrade to docker.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.1 (00h 20m 12s)
      [=======.....................] (time remaining: 01h 43m 31s)
```

也可以查看 cephadm 日志：

```
ceph -W cephadm
```

## 取消升级

可以在任何时候取消升级：

```bash
ceph orch upgrade stop
```

## Potential problems

There are a few health alerts that can arise during the upgrade process.

### UPGRADE_NO_STANDBY_MGR

Ceph requires an active and standby manager daemon in order to proceed, but there is currently no standby.

You can ensure that Cephadm is configured to run 2 (or more) managers with:

```
# ceph orch apply mgr 2  # or more
```

You can check the status of existing mgr daemons with:

```
# ceph orch ps --daemon-type mgr
```

If an existing mgr daemon has stopped, you can try restarting it with:

```
# ceph orch daemon restart <name>
```

### UPGRADE_FAILED_PULL

Ceph was unable to pull the container image for the target version. This can happen if you specify an version or container image that does not exist (e.g., 1.2.3), or if the container registry is not reachable from one or more hosts in the cluster.

You can cancel the existing upgrade and specify a different target version with:

```
# ceph orch upgrade stop
# ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version <version>
```

## Using customized container images

For most users, simplify specifying the Ceph version is sufficient. Cephadm will locate the specific Ceph container image to use by combining the `container_image_base` configuration option (default: `docker.io/ceph/ceph`) with a tag of `vX.Y.Z`.

You can also upgrade to an arbitrary container image.  For example, to upgrade to a development build:

```
# ceph orch upgrade start --image quay.io/ceph-ci/ceph:recent-git-branch-name
```

## Starting the upgrade

Before you start, you should verify that all hosts are currently online and your cluster is healthy.

```
# ceph -s
```

To upgrade (or downgrade) to a specific release:

```
# ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version <version>
```

For example, to upgrade to v15.2.1:

```
# ceph orch upgrade start --ceph-version 15.2.1
```

## Monitoring the upgrade

Determine whether an upgrade is in process and what version the cluster is upgrading to with:

```
# ceph orch upgrade status
```

While the upgrade is underway, you will see a progress bar in the ceph status output.  For example:

```
# ceph -s
[...]
  progress:
    Upgrade to docker.io/ceph/ceph:v15.2.1 (00h 20m 12s)
      [=======.....................] (time remaining: 01h 43m 31s)
```

You can also watch the cephadm log with:

```
# ceph -W cephadm
```

## Canceling an upgrade

You can stop the upgrade process at any time with:

```
# ceph orch upgrade stop
```

## Potential problems

There are a few health alerts that can arise during the upgrade process.

You can check the status of existing mgr daemons with:

```
# ceph orch ps --daemon-type mgr
```

If an existing mgr daemon has stopped, you can try restarting it with:

```
# ceph orch daemon restart <name>
```

### UPGRADE_FAILED_PULL

Ceph was unable to pull the container image for the target version. This can happen if you specify an version or container image that does not exist (e.g., 1.2.3), or if the container registry is not reachable from one or more hosts in the cluster.
