NIST还针对于云计算的服务模式提出了3个服务层次：

> Iaas：提供给用户的是云计算基础设施，包括CPU、内存、存储、网络等其他的资源服务，用户不需要控制存储与网络等基础设施。
>
> Paas：提供给用户的是云计算中的开发和分发应用的解决方案，用户能够部署应用程序，也可以控制相关的托管环境，比如云服务器及操作系统，但用户不需要接触到云计算中的基础设施。
>
> Saas：提供给用户的是云计算基础设施上的应用程序，用户只需要在客户端界面访问即可使用到所需资源，而接触不到云计算的基础设施。

# Get started with OpenStack

​                                          

The OpenStack project is an open source cloud computing platform for all types of clouds, which aims to be simple to implement, massively scalable, and feature rich. Developers and cloud computing technologists from around the world create the OpenStack project.

OpenStack provides an [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Infrastructure-as-a-Service-IaaS) solution through a set of interrelated services. Each service offers an [Application Programming Interface (API)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Application-Programming-Interface-API) that facilitates this integration. Depending on your needs, you can install some or all services.

## The OpenStack services[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/get-started-with-openstack.html#the-openstack-services)

The [OpenStack project navigator](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components) lets you browse the OpenStack services that make up the OpenStack architecture. The services are categorized per the service type and release series.

## The OpenStack architecture[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/get-started-with-openstack.html#the-openstack-architecture)

The following sections describe the OpenStack architecture in more detail:

- [Conceptual architecture](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/get-started-conceptual-architecture.html)
- [Logical architecture](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/get-started-logical-architecture.html)

开始使用Open Stack

Open Stack项目是一个适用于所有类型云的开源云计算平台，其目标是实现简单、可大规模扩展和功能丰富。来自世界各地的开发人员和云计算技术人员创建了Open Stack项目。

Open Stack通过一组相互关联的服务提供基础设施即服务（Iaa S）解决方案。每个服务都提供了一个应用程序编程接口（API）来促进这种集成。根据您的需要，您可以安装部分或全部服务。

开放堆栈服务¶

Open Stack项目导航器允许您浏览组成Open Stack体系结构的Open Stack服务。服务按照服务类型和发布系列进行分类。

开放堆栈体系结构¶

以下部分更详细地描述了开放堆栈体系结构：

概念架构

逻辑体系结构

# Conceptual architecture

​                                          



The following diagram shows the relationships among the OpenStack services:

[![OpenStack conceptual architecture](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/openstack_kilo_conceptual_arch.png)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/openstack_kilo_conceptual_arch.png)

概念架构

下图显示了Open Stack服务之间的关系：

# Logical architecture

​                                          

To design, deploy, and configure OpenStack, administrators must understand the logical architecture.

As shown in [Conceptual architecture](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/get-started-conceptual-architecture.html#get-started-conceptual-architecture), OpenStack consists of several independent parts, named the OpenStack services. All services authenticate through a common Identity service. Individual services interact with each other through public APIs, except where privileged administrator commands are necessary.

Internally, OpenStack services are composed of several processes. All services have at least one API process, which listens for API requests, preprocesses them and passes them on to other parts of the service. With the exception of the Identity service, the actual work is done by distinct processes.

For communication between the processes of one service, an AMQP message broker is used. The service’s state is stored in a database. When deploying and configuring your OpenStack cloud, you can choose among several message broker and database solutions, such as RabbitMQ, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.

Users can access OpenStack via the web-based user interface implemented by the Horizon Dashboard, via [command-line clients](https://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/) and by issuing API requests through tools like browser plug-ins or **curl**. For applications, [several SDKs](https://developer.openstack.org/#sdk) are available. Ultimately, all these access methods issue REST API calls to the various OpenStack services.

The following diagram shows the most common, but not the only possible, architecture for an OpenStack cloud:

[![Logical architecture](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/openstack-arch-kilo-logical-v1.png)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/openstack-arch-kilo-logical-v1.png)

逻辑体系结构

要设计、部署和配置Open Stack，管理员必须了解逻辑体系结构。

如概念体系结构所示，Open Stack由几个独立的部分组成，命名为Open Stack服务。所有服务都通过通用身份服务进行身份验证。各个服务通过公共API相互交互，除非需要特权管理员命令。

在内部，Open Stack服务由几个进程组成。所有服务都至少有一个API进程，该进程侦听API请求，对其进行预处理并将其传递给服务的其他部分。除了身份服务之外，实际工作是由不同的流程完成的。

对于一个服务的进程之间的通信，使用AMQP消息代理。服务的状态存储在数据库中。在部署和配置Open Stack云时，您可以在多种消息代理和数据库解决方案中进行选择，如Rabbit MQ、My SQL、Maria DB和SQLite。

用户可以通过Horizon Dashboard实现的基于web的用户界面、命令行客户端以及通过浏览器插件或curl等工具发出API请求来访问Open  Stack。对于应用程序，有几个SDK可用。最终，所有这些访问方法都会向各种Open Stack服务发出REST API调用。

下图显示了Open Stack云最常见但并非唯一可能的架构：

# Overview

​                                          

The [OpenStack](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-OpenStack) project is an open source cloud computing platform that supports all types of cloud environments. The project aims for simple implementation, massive scalability, and a rich set of features. Cloud computing experts from around the world contribute to the project.

OpenStack provides an [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Infrastructure-as-a-Service-IaaS) solution through a variety of complementary services. Each service offers an [Application Programming Interface (API)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Application-Programming-Interface-API) that facilitates this integration.

This guide covers step-by-step deployment of the major OpenStack services using a functional example architecture suitable for new users of OpenStack with sufficient Linux experience. This guide is not intended to be used for production system installations, but to create a minimum proof-of-concept for the purpose of learning about OpenStack.

After becoming familiar with basic installation, configuration, operation, and troubleshooting of these OpenStack services, you should consider the following steps toward deployment using a production architecture:

- Determine and implement the necessary core and optional services to meet performance and redundancy requirements.
- Increase security using methods such as firewalls, encryption, and service policies.
- Use a deployment tool such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Salt to automate deployment and management of the production environment. The OpenStack project has a couple of deployment projects with specific guides per version: - [Yoga release](https://docs.openstack.org/yoga/deploy/) - [Xena release](https://docs.openstack.org/xena/deploy/) - [Wallaby release](https://docs.openstack.org/wallaby/deploy/) - [Victoria release](https://docs.openstack.org/victoria/deploy/) - [Ussuri release](https://docs.openstack.org/ussuri/deploy/) - [Train release](https://docs.openstack.org/train/deploy/) - [Stein release](https://docs.openstack.org/stein/deploy/) - [Rocky release](https://docs.openstack.org/rocky/deploy/) - [Queens release](https://docs.openstack.org/queens/deploy/) - [Pike release](https://docs.openstack.org/pike/deploy/)



## Example architecture[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#example-architecture)

The example architecture requires at least two nodes (hosts) to launch a basic [virtual machine](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-virtual-machine-VM) or instance. Optional services such as Block Storage and Object Storage require additional nodes.



 

Important



The example architecture used in this guide is a minimum configuration, and is not intended for production system installations. It is designed to provide a minimum proof-of-concept for the purpose of learning about OpenStack. For information on creating architectures for specific use cases, or how to determine which architecture is required, see the [Architecture Design Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/).

This example architecture differs from a minimal production architecture as follows:

- Networking agents reside on the controller node instead of one or more dedicated network nodes.
- Overlay (tunnel) traffic for self-service networks traverses the management network instead of a dedicated network.

For more information on production architectures for Pike, see the [Architecture Design Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/), [OpenStack Networking Guide for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/pike/admin/), and [OpenStack Administrator Guides for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/pike/admin/).

For more information on production architectures for Queens, see the [Architecture Design Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/), [OpenStack Networking Guide for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/queens/admin/), and [OpenStack Administrator Guides for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/queens/admin/).

For more information on production architectures for Rocky, see the [Architecture Design Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/), [OpenStack Networking Guide for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/rocky/admin/), and [OpenStack Administrator Guides for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/rocky/admin/).

![Hardware requirements](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/hwreqs.png)

**Hardware requirements**[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#id4)

### Controller[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#controller)

The controller node runs the Identity service, Image service, Placement service, management portions of Compute, management portion of Networking, various Networking agents, and the Dashboard. It also includes supporting services such as an SQL database, [message queue](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-message-queue), and [NTP](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Time-Protocol-NTP).

Optionally, the controller node runs portions of the Block Storage, Object Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry services.

The controller node requires a minimum of two network interfaces.

### Compute[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#compute)

The compute node runs the [hypervisor](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-hypervisor) portion of Compute that operates instances. By default, Compute uses the [KVM](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-kernel-based-VM-KVM) hypervisor. The compute node also runs a Networking service agent that connects instances to virtual networks and provides firewalling services to instances via [security groups](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-security-group).

You can deploy more than one compute node. Each node requires a minimum of two network interfaces.

### Block Storage[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#block-storage)

The optional Block Storage node contains the disks that the Block Storage and Shared File System services provision for instances.

For simplicity, service traffic between compute nodes and this node uses the management network. Production environments should implement a separate storage network to increase performance and security.

You can deploy more than one block storage node. Each node requires a minimum of one network interface.

### Object Storage[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#object-storage)

The optional Object Storage node contain the disks that the Object Storage service uses for storing accounts, containers, and objects.

For simplicity, service traffic between compute nodes and this node uses the management network. Production environments should implement a separate storage network to increase performance and security.

This service requires two nodes. Each node requires a minimum of one network interface. You can deploy more than two object storage nodes.

## Networking[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#networking)

Choose one of the following virtual networking options.



### Networking Option 1: Provider networks[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#networking-option-1-provider-networks)

The provider networks option deploys the OpenStack Networking service in the simplest way possible with primarily layer-2 (bridging/switching) services and VLAN segmentation of networks. Essentially, it bridges virtual networks to physical networks and relies on physical network infrastructure for layer-3 (routing) services. Additionally, a [DHCP](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Dynamic-Host-Configuration-Protocol-DHCP) service provides IP address information to instances.

The OpenStack user requires more information about the underlying network infrastructure to create a virtual network to exactly match the infrastructure.



 

Warning



This option lacks support for self-service (private) networks, layer-3 (routing) services, and advanced services such as [LBaaS](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Load-Balancer-as-a-Service-LBaaS) and [FWaaS](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-FireWall-as-a-Service-FWaaS). Consider the self-service networks option below if you desire these features.

### Networking Option 2: Self-service networks[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#networking-option-2-self-service-networks)

The self-service networks option augments the provider networks option with layer-3 (routing) services that enable [self-service](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-self-service) networks using overlay segmentation methods such as [VXLAN](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Virtual-Extensible-LAN-VXLAN). Essentially, it routes virtual networks to physical networks using [NAT](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Address-Translation-NAT). Additionally, this option provides the foundation for advanced services such as LBaaS and FWaaS.

The OpenStack user can create virtual networks without the knowledge of underlying infrastructure on the data network. This can also include VLAN networks if the layer-2 plug-in is configured accordingly.

概述

Open Stack项目是一个开源云计算平台，支持所有类型的云环境。该项目旨在实现简单、大规模的可扩展性和丰富的功能。来自世界各地的云计算专家为该项目做出了贡献。

Open Stack通过各种互补服务提供基础设施即服务（Iaa S）解决方案。每个服务都提供了一个应用程序编程接口（API）来促进这种集成。

本指南介绍了主要Open Stack服务的逐步部署，使用的功能示例体系结构适合具有足够Linux经验的Open Stack新用户。本指南并非用于生产系统安装，而是为了学习Open Stack而创建最低限度的概念验证。

在熟悉这些Open Stack服务的基本安装、配置、操作和故障排除后，您应该考虑使用生产体系结构进行部署的以下步骤：

确定并实施必要的核心和可选服务，以满足性能和冗余要求。

使用防火墙、加密和服务策略等方法提高安全性。

使用部署工具（如Ansible、Chef、Puppet或Salt）来自动化生产环境的部署和管理。Open  Stack项目有几个部署项目，每个版本都有特定的指南：-Yoga发布-Xena发布-Wallaby发布-Victoria发布-Ussuri发布-Train发布-Stein发布-Rocky发布-Queens发布-Pike发布

架构示例¶

示例体系结构需要至少两个节点（主机）来启动基本虚拟机或实例。块存储和对象存储等可选服务需要额外的节点。

# Environment

​                                          

This section explains how to configure the controller node and one compute node using the example architecture.

Although most environments include Identity, Image service, Compute, at least one networking service, and the Dashboard, the Object Storage service can operate independently. If your use case only involves Object Storage, you can skip to

- [Object Storage Installation Guide for Yoga](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/yoga/install/)
- [Object Storage Installation Guide for Stein](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/stein/install/)
- [Object Storage Installation Guide for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/rocky/install/)
- [Object Storage Installation Guide for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/queens/install/)
- [Object Storage Installation Guide for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/pike/install/)

after configuring the appropriate nodes for it.

You must use an account with administrative privileges to configure each node. Either run the commands as the `root` user or configure the `sudo` utility.



 

Note



The **systemctl enable** call on openSUSE outputs a warning message when the service uses SysV Init scripts instead of native systemd files. This warning can be ignored.

For best performance, we recommend that your environment meets or exceeds the hardware requirements in [Hardware requirements](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#figure-hwreqs).

The following minimum requirements should support a proof-of-concept environment with core services and several [CirrOS](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-CirrOS) instances:

- Controller Node: 1 processor, 4 GB memory, and 5 GB storage
- Compute Node: 1 processor, 2 GB memory, and 10 GB storage

As the number of OpenStack services and virtual machines increase, so do the hardware requirements for the best performance. If performance degrades after enabling additional services or virtual machines, consider adding hardware resources to your environment.

To minimize clutter and provide more resources for OpenStack, we recommend a minimal installation of your Linux distribution. Also, you must install a 64-bit version of your distribution on each node.

A single disk partition on each node works for most basic installations. However, you should consider [Logical Volume Manager (LVM)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Logical-Volume-Manager-LVM) for installations with optional services such as Block Storage.

For first-time installation and testing purposes, many users select to build each host as a [virtual machine (VM)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-virtual-machine-VM). The primary benefits of VMs include the following:

- One physical server can support multiple nodes, each with almost any number of network interfaces.
- Ability to take periodic “snap shots” throughout the installation process and “roll back” to a working configuration in the event of a problem.

However, VMs will reduce performance of your instances, particularly if your hypervisor and/or processor lacks support for hardware acceleration of nested VMs.



 

Note



If you choose to install on VMs, make sure your hypervisor provides a way to disable MAC address filtering on the provider network interface.

For more information about system requirements, see the [OpenStack Pike Administrator Guides](https://docs.openstack.org/pike/admin/), the [OpenStack Queens Administrator Guides](https://docs.openstack.org/queens/admin/), or the [OpenStack Rocky Administrator Guides](https://docs.openstack.org/rocky/admin/).

# Security

​                                          

OpenStack services support various security methods including password, policy, and encryption. Additionally, supporting services including the database server and message broker support password security.

To ease the installation process, this guide only covers password security where applicable. You can create secure passwords manually, but the database connection string in services configuration file cannot accept special characters like “@”. We recommend you generate them using a tool such as [pwgen](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/), or by running the following command:

```
$ openssl rand -hex 10
```

For OpenStack services, this guide uses `SERVICE_PASS` to reference service account passwords and `SERVICE_DBPASS` to reference database passwords.

The following table provides a list of services that require passwords and their associated references in the guide.

| Password name                        | Description                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Database password (no variable used) | Root password for the database                     |
| `ADMIN_PASS`                         | Password of user `admin`                           |
| `CINDER_DBPASS`                      | Database password for the Block Storage service    |
| `CINDER_PASS`                        | Password of Block Storage service user `cinder`    |
| `DASH_DBPASS`                        | Database password for the Dashboard                |
| `DEMO_PASS`                          | Password of user `demo`                            |
| `GLANCE_DBPASS`                      | Database password for Image service                |
| `GLANCE_PASS`                        | Password of Image service user `glance`            |
| `KEYSTONE_DBPASS`                    | Database password of Identity service              |
| `METADATA_SECRET`                    | Secret for the metadata proxy                      |
| `NEUTRON_DBPASS`                     | Database password for the Networking service       |
| `NEUTRON_PASS`                       | Password of Networking service user `neutron`      |
| `NOVA_DBPASS`                        | Database password for Compute service              |
| `NOVA_PASS`                          | Password of Compute service user `nova`            |
| `PLACEMENT_PASS`                     | Password of the Placement service user `placement` |
| `RABBIT_PASS`                        | Password of RabbitMQ user `openstack`              |

OpenStack and supporting services require administrative privileges during installation and operation. In some cases, services perform modifications to the host that can interfere with deployment automation tools such as Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. For example, some OpenStack services add a root wrapper to `sudo` that can interfere with security policies. See the [Compute service documentation for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/pike/admin/root-wrap-reference.html), the [Compute service documentation for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/queens/admin/root-wrap-reference.html), or the [Compute service documentation for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/admin/root-wrap-reference.html) for more information.

The Networking service assumes default values for kernel network parameters and modifies firewall rules. To avoid most issues during your initial installation, we recommend using a stock deployment of a supported distribution on your hosts. However, if you choose to automate deployment of your hosts, review the configuration and policies applied to them before proceeding further.

# Host networking

​                                          



After installing the operating system on each node for the architecture that you choose to deploy, you must configure the network interfaces. We recommend that you disable any automated network management tools and manually edit the appropriate configuration files for your distribution. For more information on how to configure networking on your distribution, see the documentation.

All nodes require Internet access for administrative purposes such as package installation, security updates, [DNS](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Domain-Name-System-DNS), and [NTP](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Time-Protocol-NTP). In most cases, nodes should obtain Internet access through the management network interface. To highlight the importance of network separation, the example architectures use [private address space](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) for the management network and assume that the physical network infrastructure provides Internet access via [NAT](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Address-Translation-NAT) or other methods. The example architectures use routable IP address space for the provider (external) network and assume that the physical network infrastructure provides direct Internet access.

In the provider networks architecture, all instances attach directly to the provider network. In the self-service (private) networks architecture, instances can attach to a self-service or provider network. Self-service networks can reside entirely within OpenStack or provide some level of external network access using [NAT](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Address-Translation-NAT) through the provider network.

![Network layout](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/networklayout.png)

The example architectures assume use of the following networks:

- Management on 10.0.0.0/24 with gateway 10.0.0.1

  This network requires a gateway to provide Internet access to all nodes for administrative purposes such as package installation, security updates, [DNS](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Domain-Name-System-DNS), and [NTP](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Time-Protocol-NTP).

- Provider on 203.0.113.0/24 with gateway 203.0.113.1

  This network requires a gateway to provide Internet access to instances in your OpenStack environment.

You can modify these ranges and gateways to work with your particular network infrastructure.

Network interface names vary by distribution. Traditionally, interfaces use `eth` followed by a sequential number. To cover all variations, this guide refers to the first interface as the interface with the lowest number and the second interface as the interface with the highest number.



 

Note



Ubuntu has changed the network interface naming concept. Refer [Changing Network Interfaces name Ubuntu 16.04](https://askubuntu.com/questions/767786/changing-network-interfaces-name-ubuntu-16-04).

Unless you intend to use the exact configuration provided in this example architecture, you must modify the networks in this procedure to match your environment. Each node must resolve the other nodes by name in addition to IP address. For example, the `controller` name must resolve to `10.0.0.11`, the IP address of the management interface on the controller node.



 

Warning



Reconfiguring network interfaces will interrupt network connectivity. We recommend using a local terminal session for these procedures.



 

Note



RHEL, CentOS and SUSE distributions enable a restrictive [firewall](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-firewall) by default. Ubuntu does not. For more information about securing your environment, refer to the [OpenStack Security Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/).

# Controller node

​                                          

## Configure network interfaces[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-networking-controller.html#configure-network-interfaces)

1. Configure the first interface as the management interface:

   IP address: 10.0.0.11

   Network mask: 255.255.255.0 (or /24)

   Default gateway: 10.0.0.1

2. The provider interface uses a special configuration without an IP address assigned to it. Configure the second interface as the provider interface:

   Replace `INTERFACE_NAME` with the actual interface name. For example, *eth1* or *ens224*.

   For Ubuntu:

   - Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to contain the following:

     ```
     # The provider network interface
     auto INTERFACE_NAME
     iface INTERFACE_NAME inet manual
     up ip link set dev $IFACE up
     down ip link set dev $IFACE down
     ```

   For RHEL or CentOS:

   - Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-INTERFACE_NAME` file to contain the following:

     Do not change the `HWADDR` and `UUID` keys.

     ```
     DEVICE=INTERFACE_NAME
     TYPE=Ethernet
     ONBOOT="yes"
     BOOTPROTO="none"
     ```

   For SUSE:

   - Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-INTERFACE_NAME` file to contain the following:

     ```
     STARTMODE='auto'
     BOOTPROTO='static'
     ```

3. Reboot the system to activate the changes.

## Configure name resolution[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-networking-controller.html#configure-name-resolution)

1. Set the hostname of the node to `controller`.

2. Edit the `/etc/hosts` file to contain the following:

   ```
   # controller
   10.0.0.11       controller
   
   # compute1
   10.0.0.31       compute1
   
   # block1
   10.0.0.41       block1
   
   # object1
   10.0.0.51       object1
   
   # object2
   10.0.0.52       object2
   ```

   

    

   Warning

   

   Some distributions add an extraneous entry in the `/etc/hosts` file that resolves the actual hostname to another loopback IP address such as `127.0.1.1`. You must comment out or remove this entry to prevent name resolution problems. **Do not remove the 127.0.0.1 entry.**

   

    

   Note

   

   This guide includes host entries for optional services in order to reduce complexity should you choose to deploy them.

# Compute node

​                                          

## Configure network interfaces[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-networking-compute.html#configure-network-interfaces)

1. Configure the first interface as the management interface:

   IP address: 10.0.0.31

   Network mask: 255.255.255.0 (or /24)

   Default gateway: 10.0.0.1

   

    

   Note

   

   Additional compute nodes should use 10.0.0.32, 10.0.0.33, and so on.

2. The provider interface uses a special configuration without an IP address assigned to it. Configure the second interface as the provider interface:

   Replace `INTERFACE_NAME` with the actual interface name. For example, *eth1* or *ens224*.

   For Ubuntu:

   - Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to contain the following:

     ```
     # The provider network interface
     auto INTERFACE_NAME
     iface  INTERFACE_NAME inet manual
     up ip link set dev $IFACE up
     down ip link set dev $IFACE down
     ```

   For RHEL or CentOS:

   - Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-INTERFACE_NAME` file to contain the following:

     Do not change the `HWADDR` and `UUID` keys.

     ```
     DEVICE=INTERFACE_NAME
     TYPE=Ethernet
     ONBOOT="yes"
     BOOTPROTO="none"
     ```

   For SUSE:

   - Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-INTERFACE_NAME` file to contain the following:

     ```
     STARTMODE='auto'
     BOOTPROTO='static'
     ```

3. Reboot the system to activate the changes.

## Configure name resolution[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-networking-compute.html#configure-name-resolution)

1. Set the hostname of the node to `compute1`.

2. Edit the `/etc/hosts` file to contain the following:

   ```
   # controller
   10.0.0.11       controller
   
   # compute1
   10.0.0.31       compute1
   
   # block1
   10.0.0.41       block1
   
   # object1
   10.0.0.51       object1
   
   # object2
   10.0.0.52       object2
   ```

   

    

   Warning

   

   Some distributions add an extraneous entry in the `/etc/hosts` file that resolves the actual hostname to another loopback IP address such as `127.0.1.1`. You must comment out or remove this entry to prevent name resolution problems. **Do not remove the 127.0.0.1 entry.**

  - Default gateway: `10.0.0.1`

## Configure name resolution[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-networking-storage-cinder.html#configure-name-resolution)

1. Set the hostname of the node to `block1`.

2. Edit the `/etc/hosts` file to contain the following:

   ```
   # controller
   10.0.0.11       controller
   
   # compute1
   10.0.0.31       compute1
   
   # block1
   10.0.0.41       block1
   
   # object1
   10.0.0.51       object1

Note



RHEL, CentOS and SUSE distributions enable a restrictive [firewall](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-firewall) by default. During the installation process, certain steps will fail unless you alter or disable the firewall. For more information about securing your environment, refer to the [OpenStack Security Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/).

Ubuntu does not enable a restrictive [firewall](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-firewall) by default. For more information about securing your environment, refer to the [OpenStack Security Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/).

# Network Time Protocol (NTP)

​                                          



To properly synchronize services among nodes, you can install Chrony, an implementation of [NTP](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Network-Time-Protocol-NTP). We recommend that you configure the controller node to reference more accurate (lower stratum) servers and other nodes to reference the controller node.

- [Controller node](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-ntp-controller.html)
- [Other nodes](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-ntp-other.html)
- [Verify operation](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-ntp-verify.html)

# Controller node

​                                          



Perform these steps on the controller node.

## Install and configure components[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-ntp-controller.html#install-and-configure-components)

1. Install the packages:

   For Ubuntu:

   ```
   # apt install chrony
   ```

   For RHEL or CentOS:

   ```
   # yum install chrony
   ```

   For SUSE:

   ```
   # zypper install chrony
   ```

2. Edit the `chrony.conf` file and add, change, or remove the following keys as necessary for your environment.

   For RHEL, CentOS, or SUSE, edit the `/etc/chrony.conf` file:

   ```
   server NTP_SERVER iburst
   ```

   For Ubuntu, edit the `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf` file:

   ```
   server NTP_SERVER iburst
   ```

   Replace `NTP_SERVER` with the hostname or IP address of a suitable more accurate (lower stratum) NTP server. The configuration supports multiple `server` keys.

   

    

   Note

   

   By default, the controller node synchronizes the time via a pool of public servers. However, you can optionally configure alternative servers such as those provided by your organization.

3. To enable other nodes to connect to the chrony daemon on the controller node, add this key to the same `chrony.conf` file mentioned above:

   ```
   allow 10.0.0.0/24
   ```

   If necessary, replace `10.0.0.0/24` with a description of your subnet.

4. Restart the NTP service:

   For Ubuntu:

   ```
   # service chrony restart
   ```

   For RHEL, CentOS, or SUSE:

   ```
   # systemctl enable chronyd.service
   # systemctl start chronyd.service
   ```

# Other nodes

​                                          



Other nodes reference the controller node for clock synchronization. Perform these steps on all other nodes.

## Install and configure components[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-ntp-other.html#install-and-configure-components)

1. Install the packages.

   For Ubuntu:

   ```
   # apt install chrony
   ```

   For RHEL or CentOS:

   ```
   # yum install chrony
   ```

   For SUSE:

   ```
   # zypper install chrony
   ```

2. Configure the `chrony.conf` file and comment out or remove all but one `server` key. Change it to reference the controller node.

   For RHEL, CentOS, or SUSE, edit the `/etc/chrony.conf` file:

   ```
   server controller iburst
   ```

   For Ubuntu, edit the `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf` file:

   ```
   server controller iburst
   ```

3. Comment out the `pool 2.debian.pool.ntp.org offline iburst` line.

4. Restart the NTP service.

   For Ubuntu:

   ```
   # service chrony restart
   ```

   For RHEL, CentOS, or SUSE:

   ```
   # systemctl enable chronyd.service
   # systemctl start chronyd.service
   ```

# Verify operation

​                                          



We recommend that you verify NTP synchronization before proceeding further. Some nodes, particularly those that reference the controller node, can take several minutes to synchronize.

1. Run this command on the *controller* node:

   ```
   # chronyc sources
   
     210 Number of sources = 2
     MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample
     ===============================================================================
     ^- 192.0.2.11                    2   7    12   137  -2814us[-3000us] +/-   43ms
     ^* 192.0.2.12                    2   6   177    46    +17us[  -23us] +/-   68ms
   ```

   Contents in the *Name/IP address* column should indicate the hostname or IP address of one or more NTP servers. Contents in the *MS* column should indicate *** for the server to which the NTP service is currently synchronized.

2. Run the same command on *all other* nodes:

   ```
   # chronyc sources
   
     210 Number of sources = 1
     MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample
     ===============================================================================
     ^* controller                    3    9   377   421    +15us[  -87us] +/-   15ms
   ```

   Contents in the *Name/IP address* column should indicate the hostname of the controller node.

# OpenStack packages

​                                          

Distributions release OpenStack packages as part of the distribution or using other methods because of differing release schedules. Perform these procedures on all nodes.



 

Note



The set up of OpenStack packages described here needs to be done on all nodes: controller, compute, and Block Storage nodes.



 

Warning



Your hosts must contain the latest versions of base installation packages available for your distribution before proceeding further.



 

Note



Disable or remove any automatic update services because they can impact your OpenStack environment.

# OpenStack packages for SUSE

​                                          

Distributions release OpenStack packages as part of the distribution or using other methods because of differing release schedules. Perform these procedures on all nodes.



 

Note



The set up of OpenStack packages described here needs to be done on all nodes: controller, compute, and Block Storage nodes.



 

Warning

Note



Disable or remove any automatic update services because they can impact your OpenStack environment.

## Enable the OpenStack repository[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-packages-obs.html#enable-the-openstack-repository)

- Enable the Open Build Service repositories based on your openSUSE or SLES version, and on the version of OpenStack you want to install:

  **On openSUSE for OpenStack Ussuri:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Ussuri/openSUSE_Leap_15.1 Ussuri
  ```

  **On openSUSE for OpenStack Train:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Train/openSUSE_Leap_15.0 Train
  ```

  **On openSUSE for OpenStack Stein:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Stein/openSUSE_Leap_15.0 Stein
  ```

  **On openSUSE for OpenStack Rocky:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Rocky/openSUSE_Leap_15.0 Rocky
  ```

  **On openSUSE for OpenStack Queens:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Queens/openSUSE_Leap_42.3 Queens
  ```

  **On openSUSE for OpenStack Pike:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Pike/openSUSE_Leap_42.3 Pike
  ```

  

   

  Note

  

  The openSUSE distribution uses the concept of patterns to represent collections of packages. If you selected ‘Minimal Server Selection (Text Mode)’ during the initial installation, you may be presented with a dependency conflict when you attempt to install the OpenStack packages. To avoid this, remove the minimal_base-conflicts package:

  ```
  # zypper rm patterns-openSUSE-minimal_base-conflicts
  ```

  **On SLES for OpenStack Ussuri:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Ussuri/SLE_15_SP2 Ussuri
  ```

  **On SLES for OpenStack Train:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Train/SLE_15_SP1 Train
  ```

  **On SLES for OpenStack Stein:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Stein/SLE_15 Stein
  ```

  **On SLES for OpenStack Rocky:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Rocky/SLE_12_SP4 Rocky
  ```

  **On SLES for OpenStack Queens:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Queens/SLE_12_SP3 Queens
  ```

  **On SLES for OpenStack Pike:**

  ```
  # zypper addrepo -f obs://Cloud:OpenStack:Pike/SLE_12_SP3 Pike
  ```

  

   

  Note

  

  The packages are signed by GPG key `D85F9316`. You should verify the fingerprint of the imported GPG key before using it.

  ```
  Key Name:         Cloud:OpenStack OBS Project <Cloud:OpenStack@build.opensuse.org>
  Key Fingerprint:  35B34E18 ABC1076D 66D5A86B 893A90DA D85F9316
  Key Created:      2015-12-16T16:48:37 CET
  Key Expires:      2018-02-23T16:48:37 CET
  ```

## Finalize the installation[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-packages-obs.html#finalize-the-installation)

1. Upgrade the packages on all nodes:

   ```
   # zypper refresh && zypper dist-upgrade
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   If the upgrade process includes a new kernel, reboot your host to activate it.

2. Install the OpenStack client:

   ```
   # zypper install python-openstackclient
   ```

​                      

# OpenStack packages for RHEL and CentOS

​                                          

Distributions release OpenStack packages as part of the distribution or using other methods because of differing release schedules. Perform these procedures on all nodes.



 

Warning



Starting with the Ussuri release, you will need to use either CentOS8 or RHEL 8. Previous OpenStack releases will need to use either CentOS7 or RHEL 7. Instructions are included for both distributions and versions where different.



 

Note



The set up of OpenStack packages described here needs to be done on all nodes: controller, compute, and Block Storage nodes.



 

Warning



Your hosts must contain the latest versions of base installation packages available for your distribution before proceeding further.



 

Note



Disable or remove any automatic update services because they can impact your OpenStack environment.

## Prerequisites[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-packages-rdo.html#prerequisites)



 

Warning



We recommend disabling EPEL when using RDO packages due to updates in EPEL breaking backwards compatibility. Or, preferably pin package versions using the `yum-versionlock` plugin.



 

Note



The following steps apply to RHEL only. CentOS does not require these steps.

1. When using RHEL, it is assumed that you have registered your system using Red Hat Subscription Management and that you have the `rhel-7-server-rpms` or `rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms` repository enabled by default depending on your version.

   For more information on registering a RHEL 7 system, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 System Administrator’s Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/part-Subscription_and_Support.html).

2. In addition to `rhel-7-server-rpms` on a RHEL 7 system, you also need to have the `rhel-7-server-optional-rpms`, `rhel-7-server-extras-rpms`, and `rhel-7-server-rh-common-rpms` repositories enabled:

   ```
   # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms \
     --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms --enable=rhel-7-server-rh-common-rpms
   ```

   For more information on registering a RHEL 8 system, see the [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_installation/post-installation-tasks_installing-rhel).

   In addition to `rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms` on a RHEL 8 system, you also need to have the `rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms`, `rhel-8-for-x86_64-supplementary-rpms`, and `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms` repositories enabled:

   ```
   # subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms \
     --enable=rhel-8-for-x86_64-supplementary-rpms --enable=codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
   ```

## Enable the OpenStack repository[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-packages-rdo.html#enable-the-openstack-repository)

- On CentOS, the `extras` repository provides the RPM that enables the OpenStack repository. CentOS includes the `extras` repository by default, so you can simply install the package to enable the OpenStack repository. For CentOS8, you will also need to enable the PowerTools repository.

  **When installing the Victoria release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-victoria
  # yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
  ```

  **When installing the Ussuri release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-ussuri
  # yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
  ```

  **When installing the Train release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-train
  ```

  **When installing the Stein release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-stein
  ```

  **When installing the Rocky release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-rocky
  ```

  **When installing the Queens release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-queens
  ```

  **When installing the Pike release, run:**

  ```
  # yum install centos-release-openstack-pike
  ```

- On RHEL, download and install the RDO repository RPM to enable the OpenStack repository.

  **On RHEL 7:**

  ```
  # yum install https://rdoproject.org/repos/rdo-release.rpm
  ```

  **On RHEL 8:**

  ```
  # dnf install https://www.rdoproject.org/repos/rdo-release.el8.rpm
  ```

  The RDO repository RPM installs the latest available OpenStack release.

## Finalize the installation[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-packages-rdo.html#finalize-the-installation)

1. Upgrade the packages on all nodes:

   ```
   # yum upgrade
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   If the upgrade process includes a new kernel, reboot your host to activate it.

2. Install the appropriate OpenStack client for your version.

   **For CentOS 7 and RHEL 7**

   ```
   # yum install python-openstackclient
   ```

   **For CentOS 8 and RHEL 8**

   ```
   # yum install python3-openstackclient
   ```

3. RHEL and CentOS enable [SELinux](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-SELinux) by default. Install the `openstack-selinux` package to automatically manage security policies for OpenStack services:

   ```
   # yum install openstack-selinux
   ```

# OpenStack packages for Ubuntu

​                                          

Ubuntu releases OpenStack with each Ubuntu release. Ubuntu LTS releases are provided every two years. OpenStack packages from interim releases of Ubuntu are made available to the prior Ubuntu LTS via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.



 

Note



The archive enablement described here needs to be done on all nodes that run OpenStack services.

# SQL database

​                                          

Most OpenStack services use an SQL database to store information. The database typically runs on the controller node. The procedures in this guide use MariaDB or MySQL depending on the distribution. OpenStack services also support other SQL databases including [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).



 

Note



If you see `Too many connections` or `Too many open files` error log messages on OpenStack services, verify that maximum number of connection settings are well applied to your environment. In MariaDB, you may also need to change [open_files_limit](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/server-system-variables/#open_files_limit) configuration.

# SQL database for RHEL and CentOS

​                                          

Most OpenStack services use an SQL database to store information. The database typically runs on the controller node. The procedures in this guide use MariaDB or MySQL depending on the distribution. OpenStack services also support other SQL databases including [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Install and configure components[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-sql-database-rdo.html#install-and-configure-components)

1. Install the packages:

   ```
   # yum install mariadb mariadb-server python2-PyMySQL
   ```

1. Create and edit the `/etc/my.cnf.d/openstack.cnf` file (backup existing configuration files in `/etc/my.cnf.d/` if needed) and complete the following actions:

   - Create a `[mysqld]` section, and set the `bind-address` key to the management IP address of the controller node to enable access by other nodes via the management network. Set additional keys to enable useful options and the UTF-8 character set:

     ```
     [mysqld]
     bind-address = 10.0.0.11
     
     default-storage-engine = innodb
     innodb_file_per_table = on
     max_connections = 4096
     collation-server = utf8_general_ci
     character-set-server = utf8

OpenStack services also support other SQL databases including [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).



 

Note



As of Ubuntu 16.04, MariaDB was changed to use the “unix_socket Authentication Plugin”. Local authentication is now performed using the user credentials (UID), and password authentication is no longer used by default. This means that the root user no longer uses a password for local access to the server.



 

Note



As of Ubuntu 18.04, the `mariadb-server` package is no longer available from the default repository. To install successfully, enable the `Universe` repository on Ubuntu.

## Install and configure components[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-sql-database-ubuntu.html#install-and-configure-components)

1. Install the packages:

   - As of Ubuntu 20.04, install the packages:

     ```
     # apt install mariadb-server python3-pymysql
     ```

   - As of Ubuntu 18.04 or 16.04, install the packages:

     ```
     # apt install mariadb-server python-pymysql
     ```

2. Create and edit the `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-openstack.cnf` file and complete the following actions:

   - Create a `[mysqld]` section, and set the `bind-address` key to the management IP address of the controller node to enable access by other nodes via the management network. Set additional keys to enable useful options and the UTF-8 character set:

     ```
     [mysqld]
     bind-address = 10.0.0.11
     
     default-storage-engine = innodb
     innodb_file_per_table = on

# Message queue

​                                          

OpenStack uses a [message queue](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-message-queue) to coordinate operations and status information among services. The message queue service typically runs on the controller node. OpenStack supports several message queue services including [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com), [Qpid](https://qpid.apache.org), and [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org). However, most distributions that package OpenStack support a particular message queue service. This guide implements the RabbitMQ message queue service because most distributions support it. If you prefer to implement a different message queue service, consult the documentation associated with it.

The message queue runs on the controller node.

# Etcd for SUSE

​                                          

Right now, there is no distro package available for etcd3. This guide uses the tarball installation as a workaround until proper distro packages are available.

The etcd service runs on the controller node.

## Install and configure components[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/environment-etcd-obs.html#install-and-configure-components)

1. Install etcd:

   - Create etcd user:

     ```
     # groupadd --system etcd
     # useradd --home-dir "/var/lib/etcd" \
           --system \
           --shell /bin/false \
           -g etcd \
           etcd
     ```

   - Create the necessary directories:

     ```
     # mkdir -p /etc/etcd
     # chown etcd:etcd /etc/etcd
     # mkdir -p /var/lib/etcd
     # chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
     ```

   - Determine your system architecture:

     ```
     # uname -m
     ```

   - Download and install the etcd tarball for x86_64/amd64:

     ```
     # ETCD_VER=v3.2.7
     # rm -rf /tmp/etcd && mkdir -p /tmp/etcd
     # curl -L \
           https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/${ETCD_VER}/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz \
           -o /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
     # tar xzvf /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz \
           -C /tmp/etcd --strip-components=1
     # cp /tmp/etcd/etcd /usr/bin/etcd
     # cp /tmp/etcd/etcdctl /usr/bin/etcdctl
     ```

     Or download and install the etcd tarball for arm64:

     ```
     # ETCD_VER=v3.2.7
     # rm -rf /tmp/etcd && mkdir -p /tmp/etcd
     # curl -L \
           https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/${ETCD_VER}/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-arm64.tar.gz \
           -o /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-arm64.tar.gz
     # tar xzvf /tmp/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-arm64.tar.gz \
           -C /tmp/etcd --strip-components=1
     # cp /tmp/etcd/etcd /usr/bin/etcd
     # cp /tmp/etcd/etcdctl /usr/bin/etcdctl
     ```

1. Create and edit the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf.yml` file and set the `initial-cluster`, `initial-advertise-peer-urls`, `advertise-client-urls`, `listen-client-urls` to the management IP address of the controller node to enable access by other nodes via the management network:

   ```
   name: controller
   data-dir: /var/lib/etcd
   initial-cluster-state: 'new'
   initial-cluster-token: 'etcd-cluster-01'
   initial-cluster: controller=http://10.0.0.11:2380
   initial-advertise-peer-urls: http://10.0.0.11:2380
   advertise-client-urls: http://10.0.0.11:2379
   listen-peer-urls: http://0.0.0.0:2380
   listen-client-urls: http://10.0.0.11:2379
   ```

2. Create and edit the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/etcd.service` file:

   ```
   [Unit]
   After=network.target
   Description=etcd - highly-available key value store
   
   [Service]
   # Uncomment this on ARM64.
   # Environment="ETCD_UNSUPPORTED_ARCH=arm64"
   LimitNOFILE=65536
   Restart=on-failure
   Type=notify
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/etcd --config-file /etc/etcd/etcd.conf.yml
   User=etcd
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

# Launch an instance

​                                          



This section creates the necessary virtual networks to support launching instances. Networking option 1 includes one provider (external) network with one instance that uses it. Networking option 2 includes one provider network with one instance that uses it and one self-service (private) network with one instance that uses it.

The instructions in this section use command-line interface (CLI) tools on the controller node. However, you can follow the instructions on any host that the tools are installed.

For more information on the CLI tools, see the [OpenStackClient documentation for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/server.html#server-create), the [OpenStackClient documentation for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/queens/cli/command-objects/server.html#server-create), or the [OpenStackClient documentation for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/rocky/cli/command-objects/server.html#server-create).

To use the dashboard, see the [Dashboard User Documentation for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/pike/user/), the [Dashboard User Documentation for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/queens/user/), or the [Dashboard User Documentation for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/rocky/user/).



## Create virtual networks[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#create-virtual-networks)

Create virtual networks for the networking option that you chose when configuring Neutron. If you chose option 1, create only the provider network. If you chose option 2, create the provider and self-service networks.

- [Provider network](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-provider.html)
- [Self-service network](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-selfservice.html)

After creating the appropriate networks for your environment, you can continue preparing the environment to launch an instance.

## Create m1.nano flavor[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#create-m1-nano-flavor)

The smallest default flavor consumes 512 MB memory per instance. For environments with compute nodes containing less than 4 GB memory, we recommend creating the `m1.nano` flavor that only requires 64 MB per instance. Only use this flavor with the CirrOS image for testing purposes.

```
$ openstack flavor create --id 0 --vcpus 1 --ram 64 --disk 1 m1.nano

+----------------------------+---------+
| Field                      | Value   |
+----------------------------+---------+
| OS-FLV-DISABLED:disabled   | False   |
| OS-FLV-EXT-DATA:ephemeral  | 0       |
| disk                       | 1       |
| id                         | 0       |
| name                       | m1.nano |
| os-flavor-access:is_public | True    |
| properties                 |         |
| ram                        | 64      |
| rxtx_factor                | 1.0     |
| swap                       |         |
| vcpus                      | 1       |
+----------------------------+---------+
```

## Generate a key pair[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#generate-a-key-pair)

Most cloud images support [public key authentication](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-public-key-authentication) rather than conventional password authentication. Before launching an instance, you must add a public key to the Compute service.

1. Source the `demo` project credentials:

   ```
   $ . demo-openrc
   ```

2. Generate a key pair and add a public key:

   ```
   $ ssh-keygen -q -N ""
   $ openstack keypair create --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mykey
   
   +-------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | Field       | Value                                           |
   +-------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | fingerprint | ee:3d:2e:97:d4:e2:6a:54:6d:0d:ce:43:39:2c:ba:4d |
   | name        | mykey                                           |
   | user_id     | 58126687cbcc4888bfa9ab73a2256f27                |
   +-------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   Alternatively, you can skip the `ssh-keygen` command and use an existing public key.

3. Verify addition of the key pair:

   ```
   $ openstack keypair list
   
   +-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | Name  | Fingerprint                                     |
   +-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | mykey | ee:3d:2e:97:d4:e2:6a:54:6d:0d:ce:43:39:2c:ba:4d |
   +-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   ```

## Add security group rules[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#add-security-group-rules)

By default, the `default` security group applies to all instances and includes firewall rules that deny remote access to instances. For Linux images such as CirrOS, we recommend allowing at least ICMP (ping) and secure shell (SSH).

- Add rules to the `default` security group:

  - Permit [ICMP](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Internet-Control-Message-Protocol-ICMP) (ping):

    ```
    $ openstack security group rule create --proto icmp default

## Launch an instance[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#id1)

If you chose networking option 1, you can only launch an instance on the provider network. If you chose networking option 2, you can launch an instance on the provider network and the self-service network.

- [Launch an instance on the provider network](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-provider.html)
- [Launch an instance on the self-service network](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-selfservice.html)



## Block Storage[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#block-storage)

If your environment includes the Block Storage service, you can create a volume and attach it to an instance.

- [Block Storage](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-cinder.html)

## Orchestration[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#orchestration)

If your environment includes the Orchestration service, you can create a stack that launches an instance.

For more information, see the [Orchestration installation guide for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/pike/install/), the [Orchestration installation guide for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/queens/install/), or the [Orchestration installation guide for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/rocky/install/).

## Shared File Systems[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance.html#shared-file-systems)

If your environment includes the Shared File Systems service, you can create a share and mount it in an instance.

For more information, see the [Shared File Systems installation guide for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/manila/pike/install/), the [Shared File Systems installation guide for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/manila/queens/install/), or the [Shared File Systems installation guide for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/manila/rocky/install/).

# Provider network

​                                          



Before launching an instance, you must create the necessary virtual network infrastructure. For networking option 1, an instance uses a provider (external) network that connects to the physical network infrastructure via layer-2 (bridging/switching). This network includes a DHCP server that provides IP addresses to instances.

The `admin` or other privileged user must create this network because it connects directly to the physical network infrastructure.



 

Note



The following instructions and diagrams use example IP address ranges. You must adjust them for your particular environment.

![Networking Option 1: Provider networks - Overview](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/_images/network1-overview.png)

**Networking Option 1: Provider networks - Overview**[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-provider.html#id1)

**Networking Option 1: Provider networks - Connectivity**[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-provider.html#id2)

## Create the provider network[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-provider.html#create-the-provider-network)

1. On the controller node, source the `admin` credentials to gain access to admin-only CLI commands:

   ```
   $ . admin-openrc
   ```

2. Create the network:

   ```
   $ openstack network create  --share --external \
     --provider-physical-network provider \
     --provider-network-type flat provider
   
   Created a new network:

   ```

   The `--share` option allows all projects to use the virtual network.

   The `--external` option defines the virtual network to be external. If you wish to create an internal network, you can use `--internal` instead. Default value is `internal`.

   The `--provider-physical-network provider` and `--provider-network-type flat` options connect the flat virtual network to the flat (native/untagged) physical network on the `eth1` interface on the host using information from the following files:

   `ml2_conf.ini`:

   ```
   [ml2_type_flat]
   flat_networks = provider
   ```

   `linuxbridge_agent.ini`:

   ```
   [linux_bridge]
   physical_interface_mappings = provider:eth1
   ```

3. Create a subnet on the network:

   ```
   $ openstack subnet create --network provider \
     --allocation-pool start=START_IP_ADDRESS,end=END_IP_ADDRESS \
     --dns-nameserver DNS_RESOLVER --gateway PROVIDER_NETWORK_GATEWAY \
     --subnet-range PROVIDER_NETWORK_CIDR provider
   ```

   Replace `PROVIDER_NETWORK_CIDR` with the subnet on the provider physical network in CIDR notation.

   Replace `START_IP_ADDRESS` and `END_IP_ADDRESS` with the first and last IP address of the range within the subnet that you want to allocate for instances. This range must not include any existing active IP addresses.

   Replace `DNS_RESOLVER` with the IP address of a DNS resolver. In most cases, you can use one from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on the host.

   Replace `PROVIDER_NETWORK_GATEWAY` with the gateway IP address on the provider network, typically the “.1” IP address.

   **Example**

   The provider network uses 203.0.113.0/24 with a gateway on 203.0.113.1. A DHCP server assigns each instance an IP address from 203.0.113.101 to 203.0.113.250. All instances use 8.8.4.4 as a DNS resolver.

   ```
   $ openstack subnet create --network provider \
     --allocation-pool start=203.0.113.101,end=203.0.113.250 \
     --dns-nameserver 8.8.4.4 --gateway 203.0.113.1 \
     --subnet-range 203.0.113.0/24 provider
   
   Created a new subnet:

# Self-service network

​                                          



If you chose networking option 2, you can also create a self-service (private) network that connects to the physical network infrastructure via NAT. This network includes a DHCP server that provides IP addresses to instances. An instance on this network can automatically access external networks such as the Internet. However, access to an instance on this network from external networks such as the Internet requires a [floating IP address](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-floating-IP-address).

The `demo` or other unprivileged user can create this network because it provides connectivity to instances within the `demo` project only.



 

Warning



You must [create the provider network](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-provider.html#launch-instance-networks-provider) before the self-service network.



 

Note



The following instructions and diagrams use example IP address ranges. You must adjust them for your particular environment.

## Create the self-service network[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-selfservice.html#create-the-self-service-network)

1. On the controller node, source the `demo` credentials to gain access to user-only CLI commands:

   ```
   $ . demo-openrc
   ```

2. Create the network:

   ```
   $ openstack network create selfservice

   ```

   Non-privileged users typically cannot supply additional parameters to this command. The service automatically chooses parameters using information from the following files:

   `ml2_conf.ini`:

   ```
   [ml2]
   tenant_network_types = vxlan
   
   [ml2_type_vxlan]
   vni_ranges = 1:1000
   ```

3. Create a subnet on the network:

   ```
   $ openstack subnet create --network selfservice \
     --dns-nameserver DNS_RESOLVER --gateway SELFSERVICE_NETWORK_GATEWAY \
     --subnet-range SELFSERVICE_NETWORK_CIDR selfservice
   ```

   Replace `DNS_RESOLVER` with the IP address of a DNS resolver. In most cases, you can use one from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on the host.

   Replace `SELFSERVICE_NETWORK_GATEWAY` with the gateway you want to use on the self-service network, typically the “.1” IP address.

   Replace `SELFSERVICE_NETWORK_CIDR` with the subnet you want to use on the self-service network. You can use any arbitrary value, although we recommend a network from [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918).

   **Example**

   The self-service network uses 172.16.1.0/24 with a gateway on 172.16.1.1. A DHCP server assigns each instance an IP address from 172.16.1.2 to 172.16.1.254. All instances use 8.8.4.4 as a DNS resolver.

   ```
   $ openstack subnet create --network selfservice \
     --dns-nameserver 8.8.4.4 --gateway 172.16.1.1 \
     --subnet-range 172.16.1.0/24 selfservice
   
   Created a new subnet:

## Create a router[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-selfservice.html#create-a-router)

Self-service networks connect to provider networks using a virtual router that typically performs bidirectional NAT. Each router contains an interface on at least one self-service network and a gateway on a provider network.

The provider network must include the `router:external` option to enable self-service routers to use it for connectivity to external networks such as the Internet. The `admin` or other privileged user must include this option during network creation or add it later. In this case, the `router:external` option was set by using the `--external` parameter when creating the `provider` network.

1. On the controller node, source the `demo` credentials to gain access to user-only CLI commands:

   ```
   $ . demo-openrc
   ```

2. Create the router:

   ```
   $ openstack router create router
   
   Created a new router:
   +-------------------------+--------------------------------------+

   +-------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

3. Add the self-service network subnet as an interface on the router:

   ```
   $ openstack router add subnet router selfservice
   ```

4. Set a gateway on the provider network on the router:

   ```
   $ openstack router set router --external-gateway provider
   ```

## Verify operation[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-networks-selfservice.html#verify-operation)

We recommend that you verify operation and fix any issues before proceeding. The following steps use the IP address ranges from the network and subnet creation examples.

1. On the controller node, source the `admin` credentials to gain access to admin-only CLI commands:

   ```
   $ . admin-openrc
   ```

2. List network namespaces. You should see one `qrouter` namespace and two `qdhcp` namespaces.

   ```
   $ ip netns
   
   qrouter-89dd2083-a160-4d75-ab3a-14239f01ea0b
   qdhcp-7c6f9b37-76b4-463e-98d8-27e5686ed083
   qdhcp-0e62efcd-8cee-46c7-b163-d8df05c3c5ad
   ```

3. List ports on the router to determine the gateway IP address on the provider network:

   ```

# Launch an instance on the provider network

​                                          



## Determine instance options[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-provider.html#determine-instance-options)

To launch an instance, you must at least specify the flavor, image name, network, security group, key, and instance name.

1. On the controller node, source the `demo` credentials to gain access to user-only CLI commands:

   ```
   $ . demo-openrc
   ```

2. A flavor specifies a virtual resource allocation profile which includes processor, memory, and storage.

   List available flavors:

   ```
   $ openstack flavor list
   
   +----+---------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
   | ID | Name    | RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
   +----+---------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
   | 0  | m1.nano |  64 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
   +----+---------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   You can also reference a flavor by ID.

3. List available images:

   ```
   $ openstack image list
   
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
   | ID                                   | Name   | Status |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
   | 390eb5f7-8d49-41ec-95b7-68c0d5d54b34 | cirros | active |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
   ```

   This instance uses the `cirros` image.

4. List available networks:

   ```
   $ openstack network list
   
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
   | 4716ddfe-6e60-40e7-b2a8-42e57bf3c31c | selfservice  | 2112d5eb-f9d6-45fd-906e-7cabd38b7c7c |
   | b5b6993c-ddf9-40e7-91d0-86806a42edb8 | provider     | 310911f6-acf0-4a47-824e-3032916582ff |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

   This instance uses the `provider` provider network. However, you must reference this network using the ID instead of the name.

   

    

   Note

   

   If you chose option 2, the output should also contain the `selfservice` self-service network.

5. List available security groups:

   ```
   $ openstack security group list
   
   +--------------------------------------+---------+------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Name    | Description            | Project                          |
   +--------------------------------------+---------+------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | dd2b614c-3dad-48ed-958b-b155a3b38515 | default | Default security group | a516b957032844328896baa01e0f906c |
   +--------------------------------------+---------+------------------------+----------------------------------+
   ```

   This instance uses the `default` security group.

## Launch the instance[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-provider.html#launch-the-instance)

1. Launch the instance:

   Replace `PROVIDER_NET_ID` with the ID of the `provider` provider network.

   

    

   Note

   

   If you chose option 1 and your environment contains only one network, you can omit the `--nic` option because OpenStack automatically chooses the only network available.

   ```
   $ openstack server create --flavor m1.nano --image cirros \
     --nic net-id=PROVIDER_NET_ID --security-group default \
     --key-name mykey provider-instance

   +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   ```

2. Check the status of your instance:

   ```
   $ openstack server list
   
   +--------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+------------------------+------------+
   | ID                                   | Name              | Status | Networks               | Image Name |
   +--------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+------------------------+------------+
   | 181c52ba-aebc-4c32-a97d-2e8e82e4eaaf | provider-instance | ACTIVE | provider=203.0.113.103 | cirros     |
   +--------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+------------------------+------------+
   ```

   The status changes from `BUILD` to `ACTIVE` when the build process successfully completes.

## Access the instance using the virtual console[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-provider.html#access-the-instance-using-the-virtual-console)

1. Obtain a [Virtual Network Computing (VNC)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Virtual-Network-Computing-VNC) session URL for your instance and access it from a web browser:

   ```
   $ openstack console url show provider-instance
   
   +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Field | Value                                                                           |
   +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | type  | novnc                                                                           |
   | url   | http://controller:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=5eeccb47-525c-4918-ac2a-3ad1e9f1f493 |
   +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   If your web browser runs on a host that cannot resolve the `controller` host name, you can replace `controller` with the IP address of the management interface on your controller node.

   The CirrOS image includes conventional user name/password authentication and provides these credentials at the login prompt. After logging into CirrOS, we recommend that you verify network connectivity using `ping`.

2. Verify access to the provider physical network gateway:

   ```
   $ ping -c 4 203.0.113.1
   
   PING 203.0.113.1 (203.0.113.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.929/1.539/3.183/0.951 ms
   ```

2. Access your instance using SSH from the controller node or any host on the provider physical network:

   ```
   $ ssh cirros@203.0.113.103
   
   The authenticity of host '203.0.113.102 (203.0.113.102)' can't be established.
   RSA key fingerprint is ed:05:e9:e7:52:a0:ff:83:68:94:c7:d1:f2:f8:e2:e9.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   Warning: Permanently added '203.0.113.102' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
   ```

If your instance does not launch or seem to work as you expect, see the [Troubleshoot Compute documentation for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/pike/admin/support-compute.html), the [Troubleshoot Compute documentation for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/queens/admin/support-compute.html), or the [Troubleshoot Compute documentation for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/admin/support-compute.html) for more information or use one of the [many other options](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/app-support.html) to seek assistance. We want your first installation to work!

# Launch an instance on the self-service network

​                                          



## Determine instance options[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-selfservice.html#determine-instance-options)

To launch an instance, you must at least specify the flavor, image name, network, security group, key, and instance name.

1. On the controller node, source the `demo` credentials to gain access to user-only CLI commands:

   ```
   $ . demo-openrc
   ```

2. A flavor specifies a virtual resource allocation profile which includes processor, memory, and storage.

   List available flavors:

   ```
   $ openstack flavor list
   
   +----+---------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+

   +----+---------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
   | 0  | m1.nano |  64 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
   +----+---------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   You can also reference a flavor by ID.

3. List available images:

   ```
   $ openstack image list
   
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
   | ID                                   | Name   | Status |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
   | 390eb5f7-8d49-41ec-95b7-68c0d5d54b34 | cirros | active |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+
   ```

   This instance uses the `cirros` image.

4. List available networks:

   ```
   $ openstack network list
   
   +--------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Name        | Subnets                              |

   +--------------------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

   This instance uses the `selfservice` self-service network. However, you must reference this network using the ID instead of the name.

5. List available security groups:

   ```
   $ openstack security group list
   
   +--------------------------------------+---------+------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Name    | Description            |

7. Check the status of your instance:

   ```
   $ openstack server list
   
   +--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Name                 | Status | Networks               |
   +--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+------------------------+
   | 113c5892-e58e-4093-88c7-e33f502eaaa4 | selfservice-instance | ACTIVE | selfservice=172.16.1.3 |
   | 181c52ba-aebc-4c32-a97d-2e8e82e4eaaf | provider-instance    | ACTIVE | provider=203.0.113.103 |
   +--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+------------------------+
   ```

   The status changes from `BUILD` to `ACTIVE` when the build process successfully completes.

## Access the instance using a virtual console[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-selfservice.html#access-the-instance-using-a-virtual-console)

1. Obtain a [Virtual Network Computing (VNC)](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-Virtual-Network-Computing-VNC) session URL for your instance and access it from a web browser:

   ```
   $ openstack console url show selfservice-instance
   
   +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Field | Value                                                                           |
   +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | type  | novnc                                                                           |
   | url   | http://controller:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=5eeccb47-525c-4918-ac2a-3ad1e9f1f493 |
   +-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   If your web browser runs on a host that cannot resolve the `controller` host name, you can replace `controller` with the IP address of the management interface on your controller node.

   The CirrOS image includes conventional user name/password authentication and provides these credentials at the login prompt. After logging into CirrOS, we recommend that you verify network connectivity using `ping`.

2. Verify access to the self-service network gateway:

   ```
   $ ping -c 4 172.16.1.1
   
   PING 172.16.1.1 (172.16.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.357/0.451/0.504/0.055 ms
   ```

3. Verify access to the internet:

   ```
   $ ping -c 4 openstack.org
   
   PING openstack.org (174.143.194.225) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 174.143.194.225: icmp_req=1 ttl=53 time=17.4 ms

   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 17.431/17.575/17.734/0.143 ms
   ```

## Access the instance remotely[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-selfservice.html#access-the-instance-remotely)

1. Create a [floating IP address](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/glossary.html#term-floating-IP-address) on the provider virtual network:

   ```
   $ openstack floating ip create provider
   
   +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Field               | Value                                |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | created_at          | 2017-01-20T17:29:16Z                 |
   | description         |                                      |
   | fixed_ip_address    | None                                 |
   | floating_ip_address | 203.0.113.104                        |
   | floating_network_id | b5b6993c-ddf9-40e7-91d0-86806a42edb8 |
   | headers             |                                      |
   | id                  | 88b4d06a-d794-4406-affd-6ffa2bcf1e2a |
   | port_id             | None                                 |
   | project_id          | ed0b60bf607743088218b0a533d5943f     |
   | revision_number     | 1                                    |
   | router_id           | None                                 |
   | status              | DOWN                                 |
   | updated_at          | 2017-01-20T17:29:16Z                 |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

2. Associate the floating IP address with the instance:

   ```
   $ openstack server add floating ip selfservice-instance 203.0.113.104
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   This command provides no output.

3. Check the status of your floating IP address:

   ```
   $ openstack server list
   
   +--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Name                 | Status | Networks                              |
   +--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+
   | 113c5892-e58e-4093-88c7-e33f502eaaa4 | selfservice-instance | ACTIVE | selfservice=172.16.1.3, 203.0.113.104 |
   | 181c52ba-aebc-4c32-a97d-2e8e82e4eaaf | provider-instance    | ACTIVE | provider=203.0.113.103                |
   +--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+---------------------------------------+
   ```

4. Verify connectivity to the instance via floating IP address from the controller node or any host on the provider physical network:

   ```
   $ ping -c 4 203.0.113.104
   
   PING 203.0.113.104 (203.0.113.104) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 203.0.113.104: icmp_req=1 ttl=63 time=3.18 ms
   64 bytes from 203.0.113.104: icmp_req=2 ttl=63 time=0.981 ms
   64 bytes from 203.0.113.104: icmp_req=3 ttl=63 time=1.06 ms
   64 bytes from 203.0.113.104: icmp_req=4 ttl=63 time=0.929 ms
   
   --- 203.0.113.104 ping statistics ---
   4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3002ms
   rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.929/1.539/3.183/0.951 ms
   ```

5. Access your instance using SSH from the controller node or any host on the provider physical network:

   ```
   $ ssh cirros@203.0.113.104
   
   The authenticity of host '203.0.113.104 (203.0.113.104)' can't be established.
   RSA key fingerprint is ed:05:e9:e7:52:a0:ff:83:68:94:c7:d1:f2:f8:e2:e9.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   Warning: Permanently added '203.0.113.104' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
   ```

If your instance does not launch or seem to work as you expect, see the [Troubleshoot Compute documentation for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/pike/admin/support-compute.html), the [Troubleshoot Compute documentation for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/queens/admin/support-compute.html), or the [Troubleshoot Compute documentation for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/rocky/admin/support-compute.html) for more information or use one of the [many other options](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/common/app-support.html) to seek assistance. We want your first installation to work!

## Create a volume[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-cinder.html#create-a-volume)

1. Source the `demo` credentials to perform the following steps as a non-administrative project:

   ```
   $ . demo-openrc
   ```

2. Create a 1 GB volume:

   ```
   $ openstack volume create --size 1 volume1

   +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
   ```

3. After a short time, the volume status should change from `creating` to `available`:

   ```
   $ openstack volume list
   
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+------+-------------+
   | ID                                   | Display Name | Status    | Size | Attached to |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+------+-------------+
   | a1e8be72-a395-4a6f-8e07-856a57c39524 | volume1      | available |    1 |             |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+------+-------------+
   ```

## Attach the volume to an instance[¶](https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/launch-instance-cinder.html#attach-the-volume-to-an-instance)

1. Attach a volume to an instance:

   ```
   $ openstack server add volume INSTANCE_NAME VOLUME_NAME
   ```

   Replace `INSTANCE_NAME` with the name of the instance and `VOLUME_NAME` with the name of the volume you want to attach to it.

   **Example**

   Attach the `volume1` volume to the `provider-instance` instance:

   ```
   $ openstack server add volume provider-instance volume1
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   This command provides no output.

2. List volumes:

   ```
   $ openstack volume list
   
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------+------+--------------------------------------------+
   | ID                                   | Display Name | Status | Size | Attached to                                |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------+------+--------------------------------------------+
   | a1e8be72-a395-4a6f-8e07-856a57c39524 | volume1      | in-use |    1 | Attached to provider-instance on /dev/vdb  |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------+------+--------------------------------------------+
   ```

3. Access your instance using SSH and use the `fdisk` command to verify presence of the volume as the `/dev/vdb` block storage device:

   ```
    $ sudo fdisk -l
   
    Disk /dev/vda: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 130 cylinders, total 2097152 sectors
    Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disk identifier: 0x00000000
   
       Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
   /dev/vda1   *       16065     2088449     1036192+  83  Linux
   
    Disk /dev/vdb: 1073 MB, 1073741824 bytes
    16 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2080 cylinders, total 2097152 sectors
    Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
    Disk identifier: 0x00000000
   
    Disk /dev/vdb doesn't contain a valid partition table
   ```

   

    

   Note

   

   You must create a file system on the device and mount it to use the volume.

For more information about how to manage volumes, see the [python-openstackclient documentation for Pike](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/volume.html), the [python-openstackclient documentation for Queens](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/queens/cli/command-objects/volume.html), or the [python-openstackclient documentation for Rocky](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/rocky/cli/command-objects/volume.html).

# Firewalls and default ports

​                                          

On some deployments, such as ones where restrictive firewalls are in place, you might need to manually configure a firewall to permit OpenStack service traffic.

To manually configure a firewall, you must permit traffic through the ports that each OpenStack service uses. This table lists the default ports that each OpenStack service uses:

| OpenStack service                                            | Default ports    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Application Catalog (`murano`)                               | 8082             |

To function properly, some OpenStack components depend on other, non-OpenStack services. For example, the OpenStack dashboard uses HTTP for non-secure communication. In this case, you must configure the firewall to allow traffic to and from HTTP.

This table lists the ports that other OpenStack components use:

| Service                       | Default port | Used by                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HTTP                          | 80           | OpenStack dashboard (`Horizon`) when it is not configured to use secure access. |
| HTTP alternate                | 8080         | OpenStack Object Storage (`swift`) service.                  |
| HTTPS                         | 443          | Any OpenStack service that is enabled for SSL, especially secure-access dashboard. |
| rsync                         | 873          | OpenStack Object Storage. Required.                          |
| iSCSI target                  | 3260         | OpenStack Block Storage. Required when using LVM with iSCSI target (tgt, LIO, iSER) |
| NVMe-oF target                | 4420         | OpenStack Block Storage. Required when using LVM with NVMe-oF target (nvmet). |
| MySQL database service        | 3306         | Most OpenStack components.                                   |
| Message Broker (AMQP traffic) | 5672         | OpenStack Block Storage, Networking, Orchestration, and Compute. |

On some deployments, the default port used by a service may fall within the defined local port range of a host. To check a host’s local port range:

```
$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
```

If a service’s default port falls within this range, run the following program to check if the port has already been assigned to another application:

```
$ lsof -i :PORT
```

Configure the service to use a different port if the default port is already being used by another application.
