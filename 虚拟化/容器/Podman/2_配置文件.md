###  registries.conf 文件

#### Man Page: [registries.conf.5](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md)

####  手册页：registries.conf.5

```
/etc/containers/registries.conf
```

registries.conf is the configuration file which specifies which container registries  should be consulted when completing image names which do not include a  registry or domain portion.
Registries.conf 是一个配置文件，它指定在填写不包括注册表或域部分的镜像名称时应查阅哪些容器注册表。

#### Example from the Fedora `containers-common` package

$ cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
# For more information on this configuration file, see containers-registries.conf(5).
#
# NOTE: RISK OF USING UNQUALIFIED IMAGE NAMES
# We recommend always using fully qualified image names including the registry
# server (full dns name), namespace, image name, and tag
# (e.g., registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest). Pulling by digest (i.e.,
# quay.io/repository/name@digest) further eliminates the ambiguity of tags.
# When using short names, there is always an inherent risk that the image being
# pulled could be spoofed. For example, a user wants to pull an image named
# `foobar` from a registry and expects it to come from myregistry.com. If
# myregistry.com is not first in the search list, an attacker could place a
# different `foobar` image at a registry earlier in the search list. The user
# would accidentally pull and run the attacker's image and code rather than the
# intended content. We recommend only adding registries which are completely
# trusted (i.e., registries which don't allow unknown or anonymous users to
# create accounts with arbitrary names). This will prevent an image from being
# spoofed, squatted or otherwise made insecure.  If it is necessary to use one
# of these registries, it should be added at the end of the list.
#
# # An array of host[:port] registries to try when pulling an unqualified image, in order.
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.fedoraproject.org", "registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]
#
# [[registry]]
# # The "prefix" field is used to choose the relevant [[registry]] TOML table;
# # (only) the TOML table with the longest match for the input image name
# # (taking into account namespace/repo/tag/digest separators) is used.
# #
# # If the prefix field is missing, it defaults to be the same as the "location" field.
# prefix = "example.com/foo"
#
# # If true, unencrypted HTTP as well as TLS connections with untrusted
# # certificates are allowed.
# insecure = false
#
# # If true, pulling images with matching names is forbidden.
# blocked = false
#
# # The physical location of the "prefix"-rooted namespace.
# #
# # By default, this equal to "prefix" (in which case "prefix" can be omitted
# # and the [[registry]] TOML table can only specify "location").
# #
# # Example: Given
# #   prefix = "example.com/foo"
# #   location = "internal-registry-for-example.net/bar"
# # requests for the image example.com/foo/myimage:latest will actually work with the
# # internal-registry-for-example.net/bar/myimage:latest image.
# location = "internal-registry-for-example.com/bar"
#
# # (Possibly-partial) mirrors for the "prefix"-rooted namespace.
# #
# # The mirrors are attempted in the specified order; the first one that can be
# # contacted and contains the image will be used (and if none of the mirrors contains the image,
# # the primary location specified by the "registry.location" field, or using the unmodified
# # user-specified reference, is tried last).
# #
# # Each TOML table in the "mirror" array can contain the following fields, with the same semantics
# # as if specified in the [[registry]] TOML table directly:
# # - location
# # - insecure
# [[registry.mirror]]
# location = "example-mirror-0.local/mirror-for-foo"
# [[registry.mirror]]
# location = "example-mirror-1.local/mirrors/foo"
# insecure = true
# # Given the above, a pull of example.com/foo/image:latest will try:
# # 1. example-mirror-0.local/mirror-for-foo/image:latest
# # 2. example-mirror-1.local/mirrors/foo/image:latest
# # 3. internal-registry-for-example.net/bar/image:latest
# # in order, and use the first one that exists.
#
# short-name-mode="enforcing"

[[registry]]
location="localhost:5000"

### [mounts.conf](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/blob/main/f/mounts.conf)

###  mounts.conf 文件

```
/usr/share/containers/mounts.conf` and optionally `/etc/containers/mounts.conf`
 `/usr/share/containers/mounts.conf` 以及 可选 `/etc/containers/mounts.conf
```

The mounts.conf files specify volume mount directories that are automatically mounted inside containers when executing the `podman run` or `podman build` commands. Container process can then use this content. The volume mount content does not get committed to the final image.
mounts.conf 文件指定在执行 `podman run` or `podman build` 命令时自动挂载到容器内的卷挂载目录。然后，容器进程可以使用此内容。卷装载内容不会提交到最终映像。

Usually these directories are used for passing secrets or credentials required  by the package software to access remote package repositories.
通常，这些目录用于传递包软件访问远程包存储库所需的密钥或凭据。

For example, a mounts.conf with the line "`/usr/share/rhel/secrets:/run/secrets`", the content of `/usr/share/rhel/secrets` directory is mounted on `/run/secrets` inside the container. This mountpoint allows Red Hat Enterprise Linux  subscriptions from the host to be used within the container.
例如，带有 “ `/usr/share/rhel/secrets:/run/secrets` ” 行的 mounts.conf， `/usr/share/rhel/secrets` 目录的内容被挂载到 `/run/secrets` 容器内部。此挂载点允许在容器内使用来自主机的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 订阅。

Note this is not a volume mount. The content of the volumes is copied into  container storage, not bind mounted directly from the host.
请注意，这不是卷装载。卷的内容被复制到容器存储中，而不是直接从主机绑定挂载。

#### Example from the Fedora `containers-common` package:

```text
cat /usr/share/containers/mounts.conf
/usr/share/rhel/secrets:/run/secrets
```

### [seccomp.json](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/containers-common/blob/main/f/seccomp.json)

###  seccomp.json

```
/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json
```

seccomp.json contains the whitelist of seccomp rules to be allowed inside of containers. This file is usually provided by the containers-common package.
seccomp.json包含允许在容器内部的 seccomp 规则的白名单。此文件通常由 containers-common 包提供。
